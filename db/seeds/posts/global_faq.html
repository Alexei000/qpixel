<h2>What is Codidact?</h2>
<p>Codidact is an open-source initiative to provide a high-quality, community-controlled, open source Q&amp;A platform.
    Visit <a href="https://codidact.org">https://codidact.org</a> to learn more about the platform we&#39;re building to empower anyone to host a Q&amp;A community,
    or visit <a href="https://codidact.com">https://codidact.com</a> to browse our family of hosted sites.</p>
<h2>Who runs Codidact?</h2>
<p>Users just like you! The software is built and hosted by volunteers who are passionate about the need for a
    community-driven Q&amp;A site. Each site is moderated by a team of dedicated, experienced users who spend their time
    weeding out spam, coaching newcomers, and ensuring questions are on-topic and high-quality.</p>
<h2>How do I ask a question?</h2>
<p>You will need to register an account. Make sure you are logged into the appropriate topic-related site for your
    question and click the &quot;Ask Question&quot; button at the top of the page. A template should appear with helpful guidelines
    on how to ask a quality question. Note that some communities may require you to have a certain trust level before
    asking a question; always check out the local FAQ page for important information before contributing.</p>
<!--
## What are trust levels and how are they calculated?
< !-- I'm omitting any discussion of reputation for now since consensus seems to be that it is beyond MVP.
     If that is implemented we can add information here. -- >
Trust levels are the system Codidact uses to determine user privileges. Everyone starts at Trust Level 0 and gradually
gains the ability to contribute at a higher level. Trust levels are earned by positively contributing to the site.
For more information, see <https://github.com/codidact/docs/wiki/User-Privileges>.

<h2>What does it mean that Codidact is community-controlled? What makes it different from any other Q&amp;A site?</h2>
<p>Most Q&amp;A sites are run by companies whose primary goal is to make a profit for their shareholders. This leads to a
    situation where bringing in revenue can be more important than the health of the community using the site. On
    Codidact, the users control the sites they use, so there&#39;s no conflict of interest between quality and the bottom line.</p>
<h2>What license do my posts fall under?</h2>
<p>Most posts fall under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>. Some communities or contributors
    may use a license that more closely aligns with the content posted or their ideological position. Check a community&#39;s
    local FAQ page and Terms of Service for site-specific details.</p>
