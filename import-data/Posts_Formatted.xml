    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm a great fan of Tolkien's books, especially &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt;. One thing I have always wondered about in his books though, is whether the Elvish tongues were actually fully new languages. Were they totally constructed as it were from scratch, or was Tolkien patterning them after some European / other languages that were actually in use (or ancient languages out of use)?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin#Phonology" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, it was modelled on Welsh and some other Norse languages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sindarin was designed with a Welsh-like phonology. It has most of the same sounds and a similar sound structure, or phonotactics. The phonologies of Old English, Old Norse and Icelandic are also fairly close to Sindarin and, along with Welsh, certainly did have an influence on some of the language's grammatical features, especially the plurals (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Robert Jordan's fantasy novel series &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; includes a lot of short quotes in the Old Tongue, a fictional ancient language from a previous Age. Translations are provided for these, either in the text itself or in the glossary at the back of each book, but we never see more than a few sentences at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much was this language actually developed by Jordan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did he create an entire fictional language, as Tolkien did for his Middle-Earth books? Or did he just create some plausible-sounding fictional words and put them together to form the quotes he needed? Would it be possible, either from the text of the books themselves or from his unpublished notes, to actually learn the language properly to any extent?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Programming languages &amp; programs are often said to be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Turing complete&lt;/a&gt; when it's possible to simulate any &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Turing machine&lt;/a&gt; with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm now designing a constructed language for my game and I want everything to be possible to say in it. How can I know if the language is "Turing complete", that  is possible to say/describe everything using it? What would be the requirements for it? What words does the language need to have to be able to speak in it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, everything I thought about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's possible to describe the past, the present and the future (ex. "I bought a car", "I'm buying a car", "I will buy a car")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's possible to describe something (words?) (ex. "The cat is red")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's possible to describe nearby area/terrain (ex. "There is a tree")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's possible to describe plans (ex. "I want to buy a car")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any more ideas?&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In toki pona, compounding multiple words together is possible. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;tomo: room/box/structure/home&lt;br&gt;
  telo: water/fluid&lt;br&gt;
  tomo telo: bathroom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also allows compounding three words together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;tomo pi telo nasa: a bar&lt;br&gt;
  kiwen mun laso: blue moon rocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the official grammar stops, and the official stance is that larger statements are ungrammatical. However, I am wondering if it is common &lt;em&gt;in practice&lt;/em&gt; for people to compound more than three words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose I wanted to say “the broken yellow dome hut.” The official grammar would have me say something in a full sentence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;tomo sike pakala li jelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite the rules of grammar, do people ever say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;tomo sike pakala jelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or include other compounds of many words with &lt;em&gt;pi&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: I am &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; asking whether this is grammatical according to official rules. I am asking whether colloquial toki pona permits this.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Primitive Quendian (language of the Elves in Cuiviénen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avarin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various Avarin languages (some later merged with Nandorin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common Eldarin (the early language of all the Eldar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quenya (the language of the Ñoldor and the Vanyar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quendya (also Vanyarin Quenya) (daily tongue of the Vanyar: closest to archaic Quenya)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ñoldorin Quenya (also Exilic Quenya) (the "Elven Latin" of Middle-earth)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common Telerin (the early language of all the Lindar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telerin (the language of the Teleri who reached the Undying Lands)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nandorin (languages of the Nandor — some were influenced by Avarin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Original language of Greenwood the Great&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Original language of Lórinand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sindarin (language of the Sindar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doriathrin (dialect of Doriath)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Falathrin (dialect of the Falas and Nargothrond)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;North Sindarin (dialects of Dorthonion and Hithlum)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a good many dialects exist. However, we cannot exactly count how many there are, because it mentions "various" and we don't know whether there is a hierarchy of languages that have branched off somewhere else.  However, we can confirm there are at least &lt;strong&gt;17 dialects of the Elvish&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Constructed languages, like everything, is an intellectual property, and most countries worldwide do care about protecting the rights of the owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I'm about to create a new conlang, should I consider any existing patents?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My common sense suggests me that something is obvious here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;entirely copying someone else's writing system would certainly constitute a copyright infringement;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of things are public domain, e.g. SVO/OVS clause order or the Latin alphabet;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…but I'm totally lost about the case if &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; aspect(s) of existing works can be incidentally copied or deliberately borrowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where should I start here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It's a tough question, and one that may be impossible to answer. There are tons of references all over the internet, such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvish_languages" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; (whose sources look decent on this one), &lt;a href="http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Elvish_languages" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikia&lt;/a&gt;, and a half dozen others I looked at.  Basically, though, it looks as though the consensus is that the Elvish tongue is divided into Eldarin (the tongue of the elves during the March) and Avarin (the tongue of the Avari, a group of elves who never started on the migration to Valinor).  The Eldarin tongue was divided into Quenya (language of the Vanyar) and Common Telerin (the third elven tribe to take the Great Journey).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quenya was divided into Quendya (the daily tongue of the Vanyar) and Exilic Quenya (tongue of the Noldor, such as Galadriel), while the common Telerin was divided into Telerin (language of the Teleri of Valinor), Sindarin (language of the Teleri of Beleriand), and Nandorin (language of the Nandor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counting them, you would have at least a dozen, give or take a few for dialects off of the ones I've listed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In short: no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bit long: &lt;a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/orkish.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;not really, and some people have gone to the effort of analysing the Black Speech&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, the list of words we know thus far is rather scant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;agh "and"&lt;br&gt;
   ash "one"&lt;br&gt;
            -at infinitive suffix, or possibly a specialized "intentive" suffix indicating purpose: Ash nazg durbatulûk "one Ring to rule them all"&lt;br&gt;
            bagronk (DBS) "cesspool", possibly bag+ronk "cess+pool"&lt;br&gt;
            búbhosh (DBS) "great"&lt;br&gt;
            búrz "dark", (isolated from Lugbúrz, q.v.), burzum "darkness"&lt;br&gt;
            dug "filth", tentatively isolated from pushdug, q.v.&lt;br&gt;
            durb- "rule", infinitive durbat, only attested with suffixes: 
     durbatulûk "to rule them all". The verb durb- is remarkably similar to Quenya tur- of similar sense. 
            ghâsh "fire" (stated to be derived from the Black Speech, may or may not represent Sauron's original form of the word)&lt;br&gt;
            gimb- "find", infinitive gimbat, only attested with a pronominal suffix: gimbatul, "to find them"&lt;br&gt;
            glob (DBS) "fool"&lt;br&gt;
            gûl "any one of the major invisible servants of Sauron dominated entirely by his will" (A Tolkien Compass p. 172). Translated "wraith(s)" in the compound Nazgûl, "Ringwraith(s)".&lt;br&gt;
            hai "folk", in Uruk-hai "Uruk-folk" and Olog-hai "Troll-folk"; cf. also Oghor-hai.&lt;br&gt;
            ishi "in", a suffixed postposition: burzum-ishi, "in the darkness".&lt;br&gt;
            krimp- "bind", infinitive krimpat, only attested with a pronominal suffix: krimpatul, "to bind them"&lt;br&gt;
            lug "tower". Isolated from Lugbúrz, q.v.&lt;br&gt;
            Lugbúrz the Dark Tower, Sindarin Barad-dûr (Lug-búrz "Tower-dark")&lt;br&gt;
            nazg "ring": ash nazg "one ring", Nazgûl "Ring-wraith(s)"&lt;br&gt;
            Nazgûl "Ring-wraith(s)", nazg + gûl (q.v.)&lt;br&gt;
            Oghor-hai "Drúedain" (UT:379; this may or may not be pure Black Speech)&lt;br&gt;
            olog a variety of Troll apparently developed by Sauron. Olog-hai "Olog-people".&lt;br&gt;
            pushdug (DBS) "dungfilth", possibly push+dug "dung+filth"&lt;br&gt;
            ronk (DBS) "pool", tentatively isolated from bagronk, q.v.&lt;br&gt;
            skai (DBS) interjection of contempt&lt;br&gt;
            sha (DBS) interjection of contempt&lt;br&gt;
            sharkû (DBS?) "old man"&lt;br&gt;
            snaga "slave" (May be DBS.) Used of lesser breeds of Orcs (WJ:390).&lt;br&gt;
            thrak- "bring", infinitive thrakat, only attested with suffixes: thrakatulûk "to bring them all"&lt;br&gt;
            u (DBS) "to"&lt;br&gt;
            -ûk "all", suffixed to pronominal suffixes: -ulûk, "them all"&lt;br&gt;
            -ul pronominal suffix "them".&lt;br&gt;
            -um "-ness" in burzum "darkness". 
            uruk a great variety of Orc. According to WJ:390, Sauron probably borrowed this word "from the Elvish tongues of earlier times".   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abbreviation &lt;em&gt;DBS&lt;/em&gt; stands for &lt;em&gt;Debased Black Speech&lt;/em&gt;, a colloquial idiom variety of the Black Speech as used by the orcs and goblins.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Are conlangs intellectual property? Can they be copyrighted?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second question is a little more complicated. Does a certain level of public, common usage cause a conlang to become public domain, even when the language was created by a select group?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there has been some debate over &lt;a href="http://geeknation.com/axanar-judge-closes-book-on-klingon-language-debate/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the Klingon language&lt;/a&gt; regarding this, especially since there are a few people who were raised with Klingon as a secondary natural language. But I'm not certain about its legal status. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of location, consider the US generally. If a state is needed, in California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary issue here is trying to find out &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is necessary for a language to function; not even 'Chomskyan tenets' like &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-language-is-not-everything-that-noam-chomsky-said-it-is" rel="noreferrer"&gt;recursion&lt;/a&gt; (or broader concepts like classifiers and numbers) seem to be obligatory, and language in essence seems to boil down to a glorified predicate machine with parts tacked on by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%27s_area#Speaking_without_Broca's_area" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Broca's area&lt;/a&gt; — and so, the answer is, for now, &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;: we'd very much like to see a way of doing this, and it would be truly groundbreaking in linguistics, seeing as it's a major focus point for many researchers in many fields of philosophy, linguistics, psychology and neurology.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Think:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What features does a language you understand fluently have. Does your language contain that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In English, we get plurals: apple , apples. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your language contain a way to use plurals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In English, we have exceptions to cover things that feel incomplete, or "out of place": &lt;del&gt;James's&lt;/del&gt; but James'  We have leaves not &lt;del&gt;leafs&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your language contain exceptions to make your language feel "complete" and "tidy"?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's up to you to think of other examples, but I think that these were some good guidelines to follow. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Considering this question is a rehash of &lt;a href="https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/141472/is-the-klingon-alphabet-inspired-by-tibetan-alphabet"&gt;another question on SX&lt;/a&gt;, I'm inclined to say it's chance resemblance — and not a very high one at that. It is very highly plausible that it was &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061208232839/http://www.kli.org/pdf/Orthography.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;designed by a non-linguist at Paramount&lt;/a&gt; (if I understand correctly) at a time when there was no easy way of finding out about Tibetan even with the budding Internet of 1992 when the aforelinked article was published in the &lt;code&gt;HolQeD&lt;/code&gt; journal of the KLI. The article specifically says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More recently we’ve been treated to a different alphabet, (often incorrectly attributed to Michael
  Okuda, scenic designer for Star Trek: The Next Generation™), one which corresponds to the phonemes of
  Klingon as described by Okrand in The Klingon Dicitionary. While the characters themselves are easily identifiable from background displays on Star Trek: The Next Generation™ (assuming one has access to video
  equipment and a reasonably large television screen), there has never been an “official” release describing
  the particular relationship between individual glyphs and specific sounds. As Okuda has indicated (HolQeD
  1:1, 11) all Klingon background displays are composed for appearance, not communication. And yet, an
  unofficial letter to a Klingon fan group from an unnamed source at Paramount resulted in the following
  alphabet: [...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"...the producers called on professional linguist Dr. Marc Okrand to create authentic speech for the Klingons. His task was to make their language as alien as their ridged prosthetic foreheads, while still remaining pronounceable by human actors and consistent with the battle cries from the first movie.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Dr. Okrand did not base Klingon on any particular language, but drew on his knowledge of how language works to construct a wholly new language."&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Tolkien started really early in his life to develop languages. Started at 13 and developed languages till his death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tolkien was a professional philologist and a specialist in the Old
  English language. He was also interested in many languages outside his
  field and developed a particular love for the Finnish language (he
  described the finding of a Finnish grammar book as "entering a
  complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind
  and flavour never tasted before".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finnish morphology (particularly its rich system of inflection) in
  part gave rise to Quenya. Another of Tolkien's favorites was Welsh —
  and features of Welsh phonology found their way to Sindarin. Numerous
  words were borrowed from existing languages, but less and less
  obviously as Tolkien progressed. Words that are an exact match with
  existing Welsh words can be found in the early drafts of Tolkien’s
  manuscripts published as The History of Middle-earth,[4] but attempts
  to match a source to a particular Elvish word or name in works
  published during his lifetime are often very dubious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The following &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Ring#Inscription" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;inscription appears on the One Ring&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/em&gt; book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nrAvt.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nrAvt.png" alt="Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, Ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul. One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which in Black Speech can be written down as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the inscription is using different letters. I've checked &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengwar" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Tengwar&lt;/a&gt;, but I can't find any of the words (e.g. &lt;em&gt;ash&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nazg&lt;/em&gt;, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How should the inscription be read exactly, in other words, how it's transformed from the above fiery letters into latin letters?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Klingons from &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; aren't very polite, and the language developed for them reflects that - they don't exactly have many &lt;em&gt;polite&lt;/em&gt; ways to say things. The closest think I've found to a polite greeting is "&lt;a href="http://star-trek.answers.wikia.com/wiki/Klingon_for_good_morning" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Nuq'nuh&lt;/a&gt;", which translates to "What do you want?", which... isn't very polite, IMO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any way to &lt;em&gt;approximate&lt;/em&gt; a polite greeting in Klingon?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;You are likely having a hard time reading these tengwar because of &lt;a href="http://at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_general_black_speech.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;three big problems&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the style itself is such that the tengwar are &lt;a href="http://at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_calligraphy.htm#ring" rel="noreferrer"&gt;slanted and written 
calligraphically&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the mode used to write them is &lt;a href="http://at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_general_black_speech.htm#vowels" rel="noreferrer"&gt;unusual and not common&lt;/a&gt; for Elvish languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are no spaces between words!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The page linked should provide assistance; the issue is that the tengwar and tehtar behave (like in several modes) as in an abugida: the vowels are diacritics to the "host" consonants, and a null consonant is used for vowel-initial words (even when the words aren't separated by spaces).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.klingonwiki.net/En/Hello" rel="noreferrer"&gt;klignonwiki.net&lt;/a&gt;, there isn't an exact equivalent, but you do have a few options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nuqneH&lt;/strong&gt;: It's the only word that could literally be called a greeting, but literally it means, "What do you want?"

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;qavan&lt;/strong&gt;: Litterally, "Salute."  It's actually the imperative, meaning that it could come across sounding like an order.  It's a possibility, though, similar to the Greeks who greet one another with the imperative form of "Rejoice!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;qaleghneS&lt;/strong&gt;: Literally, "I am honoured to meet you."  It was used by Riker in &lt;em&gt;The Emissary&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The short answer is that there are no mechanisms in place by which one could credibly copyright, patent or otherwise secure ones language. Works you create about the language (such as a grammar document or a poem) of course fall under the same copyright laws as any other works of their kind and as such generally belong to you, but your language as of now is just as copyrightable as English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long answer, I recommend watching &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OqNis7y0hA8?t=1h4m40s" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt; by Sai (founder of the LCS) about exactly this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1adan" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Láadan&lt;/a&gt; was created, according to Wikipedia, to try an experiment in seeing if a constructed language designed specifically for women could better express the views of women better than natural Western languages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Láadan is a feminist constructed language created by Suzette Haden Elgin in 1982 to test the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, specifically to determine if development of a language aimed at expressing the views of women would shape a culture; a subsidiary hypothesis was that Western natural languages may be better suited for expressing the views of men than women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does the language aim to express this difference? What differences make it better for women to express their views than in natural Western languages?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What steps are the creators of Láadan taking to make sure that women can express themselves better in Láadan than in natural Western languages, that it will be different from those natural languages&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The way to make sure a language is detailed enough is by putting it to use. You have to write something in the language that the language was designed for in order to be able to tell if it works. For example, if you're writing an auxiliary language, you might want to see if you can express the Babel text or the Declaration of Human Rights (two popular texts for translation) to see if your language expresses them the way you intended. If you're writing a language for a fictional race, you could translate whatever kind of text that race produces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No language actually &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; a genitive case or a construct state (prepositions are an easy way to get out of either; but a constructed language can never be "wrong" even if it's very ambiguous, as long as the final product suits what you were trying to make). You probably would have decided sometime in the design process the most basic questions, like if the language uses cases. If for some reason you haven't, you will notice that this is missing when trying to write something in the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this works is that it's impossible to write sentences without deciding on the essential features of the language. Writing sentences forces you to decide on word order, for example. Using sentences with diverse syntax and morphology can also help to determine if you left something out of the language.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As @Darkgamma says, we don't know.  The closest we have would probably be &lt;strong&gt;ghâsh&lt;/strong&gt;, which means fire, and one could probably guess that the characteristic of being fire-like would be something like &lt;strong&gt;ghâshum&lt;/strong&gt;, but there is no empirical evidence for that, except that the suffix -um seems to mean -ness, as in &lt;strong&gt;burz-&lt;/strong&gt; (meaning dark) + &lt;strong&gt;-um&lt;/strong&gt; (meaning -ness), put together to form &lt;strong&gt;burzum&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;strong&gt;ghâshum&lt;/strong&gt; would literally mean "the characteristic of being like fire," not literally "lightness."&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Darkgamma's reply wasn't wrong, but I think it slightly misses the  question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of ensuring that your conlang is able to convey a certain meaning/feature is to grab a text and start translating it. If there is something in the original text you have trouble translating, try to find a way to work around it with the grammar you currently have OR invent a new construction to deal with it. In order to do the first one well you need a good awareness of your conlang's grammar. Another danger of this method is relexing the original, especially new vocabulary. Third option: Don't have your conlang be able to translate the challenging characteristic/expression of the text you're translating 'genuinely'. F.e. there's alienable vs. inalienable possession in the text you can simply translate it with the standard expression for possession in your conlang (assuming you do &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; have the distinction in your conlang).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You asked about lists. There are questionnaires used for typology which I think can be helpful for conlanging, but I don't know of anyone who has tried utilizing them. &lt;a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/tools-at-lingboard/questionnaires.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here you can find&lt;/a&gt; a link to a collection of them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of rules that are exactly the same.  For instance, Dovahzul has the &lt;a href="https://www.thuum.org/learn/grammar/sentence-structure.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;exact same parts of speech&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nouns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adverbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conjunctions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interjections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepositions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are some rules that are different: for instance, in the Dragon Language, some words can be used either as an adjective, noun, verb, or adverb, such as the word &lt;a href="https://www.thuum.org/word.php?w=nahlot" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nahlot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which means officially "Silenced," but whose meaning can be expanded to mean "silent," "silently," or "silence."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, it shares some rules with English, but no, its rules are not the same.  If you had any specific questions about specific rules, you'd have to ask those in separate questions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I am not an expert on Láadan but I was also researching it in the context of feminist communication.  This is what I found based on that research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind creating Láadan as a "feminist" language was to test the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; to see if natural languages were biased toward expressing male communication, but the language's creator, Suzette Haden Elgin, was unable to prove or disprove the hypotheses she set out to study because of low adoption of the language.  As far as I can tell, even Elgin remains uncertain on the effect of these approaches to facilitating feminine communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinctive characteristics that strike me are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is a tonal language&lt;/strong&gt; - This seems to have been very deliberate in the development of Láadan. Does this facilitate feminine thought with particularly more clarity than non-tonal languages?  I am not sure, and I couldn't find any reputable research indicating whether or not that is the case, but I suspect that when the language was being developed by Elgin she did not make it a tonal language by accident.  Since her hypotheses about the implications of Láadan on the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis remain unconfirmed, we probably don't know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The language has emotional context markers.&lt;/strong&gt;  This is presumably meant to aid in the expression of subtle emotional context to avoid ambiguity that leaves a dialogue open to interpretation and reliant on context clues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-d&lt;/em&gt; anger marker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-th&lt;/em&gt; pain marker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-li&lt;/em&gt; love marker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-lan&lt;/em&gt; celebration marker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-da&lt;/em&gt; joke marker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-di&lt;/em&gt; education marker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-ya&lt;/em&gt; fear marker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The language has many affection words&lt;/strong&gt;, for example, of love.  Like the other aspects, whether this is truly a facet that favors female communication over male based on empirical evidence is unclear to me, but it certainly satisfies many widely accepted assumptions about differences in male and female thought.  However, it should be noted that many of these assumptions are widely challenged today.  Perhaps men desire more nuanced emotional communication as well but suppress this impulse for cultural reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; love for inanimates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;áayáa&lt;/strong&gt; mysterious love, not yet known to be welcome or unwelcome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;áazh&lt;/strong&gt; love for someone sexually desired in the past, but not anymore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ab&lt;/strong&gt; love for one liked but not respected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ad&lt;/strong&gt; love for one respected but not liked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;éme&lt;/strong&gt; love for one neither liked nor respected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;am&lt;/strong&gt; love for one related by blood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ashon&lt;/strong&gt; love for one not related by blood, but kin of the heart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aye&lt;/strong&gt; love that is unwelcome and a burden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;azh&lt;/strong&gt; love for one sexually desired now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;oham&lt;/strong&gt; love for that which is holy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A language communicates ideas. If the set of ideas communicable by your language is large enough that it is adequate for any situation in your game, then it's good enough. No language is able to communicate all possible human thoughts; some conlangs (e.g. &lt;a href="http://ithkuil.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Ithkuil&lt;/a&gt;) try to expand the set of ideas that it can convey, but it is still not totally encapsulating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to think about is conflation. For example, Toki Pona may be effective at communicating a wide range of ideas, but it often conflates or simplifies concepts (the lack of words for specific numbers being an obvious example of this).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A language doesn't require grammatical structures specifically for expressing something to express it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chinese, there aren't separate future and past tenses. At the same time, it's possible to describe the past, the present and the future. Auxiliary verbs like
 要 &lt;em&gt;yào&lt;/em&gt;  "to want, to be going to" and many others can be used to describe what one would use the future tense for in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grammatical constructs like "but" aren't  necessary to convey meaning. We can use words like "caveat", "unfortunately" or "I'm afraid that" instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Languages reflect their culture. You should make your game's language reflect the culture that speaks it. If they value respect, add lots of ways of expressing deference, like Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you went back in time to 1700s England and attempted to describe the different forms of RNA Polymerase, they would not have a robust understanding of what you meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A language is a shared context between the speaker and the listener.&lt;/strong&gt; The common context allows them to communicate some subset of thoughts the human mind is capable of to each other. No language can communicate every thought- some languages have much less room for ambiguity than English, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example is trying to communicate colors to a colorblind alien race. You can teach them about the human optical system all you want, but they will still not understand the sensation of color.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;These two terms appear to be used nearly interchangeably to refer to languages with little morphology. However at the same time I sometimes see them contrasted with each other, but cannot identify a pattern. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Linguists consider sign languages to be natural languages. Surely they had been invented/constructed at some point in time by someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why are they not categorized as constructed, but as natural languages? And in what circumstances could they be considered to be constructed languages?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As we know, Toki Pona is a quite minimal language and it sometimes not easy to come up with a word we use everyday in English. The problem is that I cannot think of a non-culture-specific and easily understandable way of saying right and left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to say right (and left) in Toki Pona as those words are not a part of the official dictionary?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The constructed versus natural language distinction is less of a binary opposition, and more of a continuum. There are many spoken languages as well that can partially qualify as 'constructed', including Standard Italian and Nynorsk. Every language to some degree has been modified by someone's conscious choice. A conlang is set apart largely by the degree of conscious choice that's been applied to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signed languages, though they are relatively new on a linguistic scale, are not typically made up by a majority of constructed grammar rules and so on. The signs themselves are often consciously created (though just as often not), but the grammar around them is mostly generated spontaneously as the language is used more and more - rules begin to coalesce as people need to use their language in more and more circumstances. No one sat down and decided that in ASL, for example, you could set up a location as a pronominal referent and direct future signs toward that location as a way of referring to that pronoun. It simply happened - someone started doing it, what they were doing was sufficiently clear to get across, and then it was grammar. In a conlang, that grammar would have been the result of a conscious choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, spoken languages could have a very similar history. There's nothing that sets signed languages apart from spoken ones in this regard except their newness - we've watched sign languages come into being out of nothing, while all spoken languages are derived from some ancestor that's been lost in the depths of time. Spoken languages could have had an absolutely identical genesis, for all we know.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If I'm about to create a new conlang, should I consider any existing patents?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. It is conceivable that conlangs might be patentable under US law, but none so far have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;entirely copying someone else's writing system would certainly constitute a copyright infringement;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably not. Again, it might infringe a patent, but there are very few patents on writing systems. Copying a specific &lt;em&gt;font&lt;/em&gt; or typeface would constitute copyright infringement, but not copying the writing system in abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where should I start here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd start by reviewing &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqNis7y0hA8" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Sai's talk at LCC 6 on the legal status of conlangs&lt;/a&gt;, and the accompanying &lt;a href="http://conlang.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/LCC6_Sai.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://conlang.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/Dentons-Conlang-Memo-public-version.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;legal memo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also review &lt;a href="https://conlang.org/axanar/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the Language Creation Society's involvement in the Axanar case&lt;/a&gt; regarding whether or not Paramount "owns" Klingon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The history of sign languages is more akin to that of creoles than that of a constructed language which later gained native speakers. Consider the following two examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grammar of &lt;strong&gt;Esperanto&lt;/strong&gt; and a large chunk of its vocabulary was created, codified and written down by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._L._Zamenhof" rel="noreferrer"&gt;L. L. Zamenhof&lt;/a&gt;. People who were interested learned his language according to his rules and later passed it on to their children, creating the first native speakers of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of &lt;strong&gt;Tok Pisin&lt;/strong&gt; is described as follows: Contact between English speakers and locals of Papua New Guinea gave rise to a pidgin, an incomplete and bare-bones not-quite-language that was just good enough to communicate - everyone would have spoken it a bit differently at that point in time. It became used more commonly and was passed down as a native language to children, creating a full-fledged language. At no point however did its speakers sit down and decide on what grammar Tok Pisin ought to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now compare these with the case of the &lt;strong&gt;Nicaraguan Sign Langauge&lt;/strong&gt;, the currently only natural langauge which we have actively seen develop. Deaf children of Nicaragua previously communicated with the people closest to them with improvised home signs and gestures (in other words they had at best something akin to a pidgin). When they were brought together in a new school for the deaf, they had the need to communicate with each other. The school encouraged use of mouthing or fingerspelling Spanish, but the students, who were not native speakers of Spanish failed at learning these skills. Instead, they started communicating by using their own home signs, forming a pidgin that developed over the following years and was taught to younger students who later arrived. Over time, the language developed complexities similar to what you would find in other signed languages - evidence that it had developed beyond the initial pidgin stage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the example of Nicaraguan Sign Language is much more similar to that of Tok Pisin than that of Esperanto.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It has been claimed that the conlang &lt;a href="http://www.terjemar.net/kelen/kelen.php" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Kēlen&lt;/a&gt;, winner of the 2009 Smiley award, is supposed to challenge Greenberg's universal of always having a noun-verb distinction by eliminating verbs. In light of the fact that Kēlen has a special word-class called &lt;a href="http://www.terjemar.net/kelen/relats2.php" rel="noreferrer"&gt;relationals&lt;/a&gt;, which are four predicating words that take noun phrase arguments, is it not more factual to analyse the relationals of Kēlen as a very limited and closed class of verbs? They do seem to fulfill the same function words called "verbs" do in other languages, and are necessary for predication — another domain typically reserved for verbs (even if we assume zero-copula).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I've read that being a simple, yet more expressive, substitute for a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin" rel="noreferrer"&gt;pidgin language&lt;/a&gt; is one of the possible applications of Toki Pona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In situations where people from multiple languages come together they need to be able to communicate with each other. Pidgins are introduced or developed in these situations, but there is a limited scope to what can be said in pidgins. Over time, pidgins creolise into full natural languages. I would like to know if a language like Toki Pona (or a similarly minimal conlang) has ever successfully replaced the use of a pidgin to allow more to be said, rather than letting the pidgin creolise naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Due to the way pronouns work in place of any particular noun (subject or object) in the sentence, this often leads to ambiguous grammatical constructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this phrase in English for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help him with his writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do &lt;code&gt;him&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;his&lt;/code&gt; refer to Adam (where James will help edit Adam's essay or give him suggestions) or James (where Adam is sending James an exemplar to help James see examples of good writing)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would ambiguities like this be avoided in constructed languages? I know a simple solution is to just eliminate pronouns from the language but is there an alternative solution to allow pronouns to be used unambiguously?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm not entirely sure what Lovecraft meant by "root systems", but whenever you want to do something that human languages don't or rarely do, a good first step is looking at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_universal" rel="noreferrer"&gt;language universals&lt;/a&gt;. The traditional ones, however, as set out by Joseph Greenberg, were more about syntax and only a little about morphology, which roots would probably fall under depending on what you want to do with them. Still, we can use the same techniques. We can look at what some real languages do with roots and try to figure out what they don't do, and then do that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roots in most languages are pretty static. They have to be, because they carry the majority of semantic content for a word, so they have to remain recognizable. Some languages, though, have morphology that alters what we would think of as the root in Western languages. In many Semitic languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew, roots are combinations of consonants, usually three but sometimes two, and inflect by changing the vowels. In Arabic the consonants &lt;em&gt;k-t-b&lt;/em&gt; are a root that has to do with books and writing. The singular word "book" is &lt;em&gt;kitāb&lt;/em&gt;, the plural "books" is &lt;em&gt;kutub&lt;/em&gt;, "booklet" is &lt;em&gt;kutayyib&lt;/em&gt; with a suffix, "writer" is &lt;em&gt;kātib&lt;/em&gt;, and the verb "to write" is &lt;em&gt;kataba&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some languages also have infixes, which are affixes that are added inside the root instead of being added to the beginning (prefix) or end (suffix). Tagalog, for example: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For example, the verb takbo (meaning to run) + the infix um can be made into the word tumakbo, which equates to the simple past tense past tense ran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(From &lt;a href="http://talktagalog.com/tagalog-verbs-grammar-prefixes-infixes-suffixes/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://talktagalog.com/tagalog-verbs-grammar-prefixes-infixes-suffixes/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Arabic example, some of the morphology was inflectional, meaning it added some extra meaning to the original root--making a plural, for instance. Some was derivational, meaning we added something to the root that created a new root word--making "books" from "book" is inflectional, but making "book",  "writer", and "to write" from the root &lt;em&gt;k-t-b&lt;/em&gt; is derivational. So one possible meaning for "root system" is a system of derivational morphology, and a "unique agglutinative root system" would be a unique agglutinative system of derivational morphology. Speakers tend to regularize morphology over time, but derivational morphology is a little more resistant to it than inflectional: in English, nobody uses "whom" anymore, but we still preserve irregularities like "&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;-vincible" vs. "&lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;-beatable" vs. "&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;-sexual". So with derivational morphology, you have a bit more freedom to concoct a weird, wild system without having to simulate a bunch of lazy peasant speakers who can't be bothered to keep using your fancy inflections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, hopefully this gives you some ideas for how to create your own system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;I'm not entirely sure what Lovecraft meant by "root systems", but whenever you want to do something that human languages don't or rarely do, a good first step is looking at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_universal" rel="noreferrer"&gt;language universals&lt;/a&gt;. The traditional ones, however, as set out by Joseph Greenberg, were more about syntax and only a little about morphology, which roots would probably fall under depending on what you want to do with them. Still, we can use the same techniques. We can look at what some real languages do with roots and try to figure out what they don't do, and then do that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roots in most languages are pretty static. They have to be, because they carry the majority of semantic content for a word, so they have to remain recognizable. Some languages, though, have morphology that alters what we would think of as the root in Western languages. In many Semitic languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew, roots are combinations of consonants, usually three but sometimes two, and inflect by changing the vowels. In Arabic the consonants &lt;em&gt;k-t-b&lt;/em&gt; are a root that has to do with books and writing. The singular word "book" is &lt;em&gt;kitāb&lt;/em&gt;, the plural "books" is &lt;em&gt;kutub&lt;/em&gt;, "booklet" is &lt;em&gt;kutayyib&lt;/em&gt; with a suffix, "writer" is &lt;em&gt;kātib&lt;/em&gt;, and the verb "to write" is &lt;em&gt;kataba&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some languages also have infixes, which are affixes that are added inside the root instead of being added to the beginning (prefix) or end (suffix). Tagalog, for example: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For example, the verb takbo (meaning to run) + the infix um can be made into the word tumakbo, which equates to the simple past tense past tense ran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Here are three options you might want to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noun classes&lt;/strong&gt; assign each noun a class (well known examples include the gender systems of Indo-European languages, and also the more elaborate systems of Bantu languages). Having pronouns agree with the noun class of the nouns talked about greatly helps reduce ambiguity, though it would likely not help in your specific example with two male human participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obviation&lt;/strong&gt; is the system of having two distinct third person pronouns, one (the &lt;em&gt;proximal&lt;/em&gt;) referring to the most salient (important, topical) referent and one (the &lt;em&gt;obviative&lt;/em&gt;) to less salient ones. In your example, likely Adam would be the proximal, and James the obviative. There are nice examples on the relevant &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obviative#Examples" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third option, which is to my knowledge only attested in signed languages is &lt;strong&gt;Indexing&lt;/strong&gt;. This is basically the human language equivalent of variables in programming languages: a new variable, usually a location in the sign space, is assigned to every important referent, and referred to by pointing at the location or otherwise involving the location during signing of relevant words. I believe Lojban does something similar to this as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Isolating languages do not use inflectional morphology, i.e., using affixes or other manipulations of roots to create words--all words are seperate, and none contain multiple morphemes.  Vietnamese is an isolating language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example: the word snowman.  It has two morphemes: snow- and -man, and therefore has a morpheme-to-word ratio of 2:1.  Or take Spanish corremos, we run, which has three corr-, -e-, and -mos, for the word, present tense, and person/number.  (Please correct me if I am wrong--I don't know Spanish), so its ratio is 3:1.
In an isolating language, this ratio approaches 1:1--words stand alone and cannot be separated (hence "isolating.")  So, these concepts--"snowman" and "we are running"--would take multiple words to express, as each one would contain only a single morpheme.  Isolating languages have no inflectional morphology and no derivational morphology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, analytical languages are a broader category; they have a low morpheme-to-word ratio as well, but--and here's the big but--they can have a derivational morphology.  This means that while "we are running" would still be multiple single-morpheme words like in an isolating language, the word "snowman" could be a two-morpheme word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, isolating languages are actually a subset of analytic languages.  Analytic languages cover languages with no &lt;em&gt;inflectional&lt;/em&gt; morphology and a low morpheme-to-word ratio, while isolating languages have all that &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; no derivational morphology.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Even though the question seems trivial, it's still a hotly debated topic (as far as I'm aware). For example, in the &lt;em&gt;Oxford Handbook for Polysynthesis&lt;/em&gt;, Fernando Zúñiga says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Recent literature (e.g. Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002b) has emphasized the need to distinguish, in principle, between low-level units identified via phonological and prosodic rules (p-words) and those identified via rules of grammar (g-words).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a meaningful distinction? What other distinctions are there? What languages present problems when the concept of word is introduced to them?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I am making a conlang in which the writing system is based off of Arabic but the grammar is not all that similar to Arabic or English(more justification for calling it a conlang if grammar has little similarity to the languages it is based off of).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan for it to be agglutinative but not necessarily to the degree that Hungarian has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I thought about it long and hard and decided to assign gender to words of at least these 4 parts of speech:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nouns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pronouns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all verbs will I assign gender to. For example linking verbs like is or looks will not be assigned gender because they are used to link the subject to the action verb or to adjectives and adverbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pronouns practically already have gender in them. For example "he" is masculine. However "he" could also be neuter, at least in English because it can be used to refer to someone of unknown gender. "it" is clearly neuter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does make sense though for all nouns and adjectives to have gender. And again, there are clear examples of where 1 gender makes far more sense. An example of that is the adjective "pregnant" It makes far more sense to say "pregnant" is feminine because male pregnancy, while possible, is extremely rare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as for the assigning of gender I figured it would be like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Feminine Masculine Neuter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latin had this 3 gender system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am not so sure I would want inflections from grammatical case. I mean word order is a much simpler way to get across the same ideas as grammatical case. In other words for example instead of having the genitive case you could just use a possession marker on the possessor and either way, you get the same thing across, possession. But the possession marker is way simpler than inflecting every possessable noun for the genitive case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was wondering, should adjectives agree with the noun in all aspects including gender or would a conlang where adjectives have inherent gender and don't have to agree with the noun when it comes to gender be just fine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't want to use the concepts in English except maybe the pronouns, I am just using it as an example language for those concepts partly because that is the only language I know to fluency. As for mixing up grammatical gender with biological gender, it isn't really a mix up. It is on purpose that I say that pregnant makes more sense as being feminine and he having 2 genders depending on how it's used. I think it makes more sense to have grammatical gender based on biological gender.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Outside of Toki Pona, there haven't been any "majorly" successful attempts at making an oligomorphemic language — as far as I know. While derivational and inflectional morphology could be done away with (and its information load transferred to syntax I guess), the question is how many semantic morphemes is too few before a language becomes incomprehensibly vague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing the theoretical lowest lower limit is the set of 63 semantic primes of the &lt;a href="https://www.griffith.edu.au/humanities-languages/school-humanities-languages-social-science/research/natural-semantic-metalanguage-homepage" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Natural Semantic Metalanguage&lt;/a&gt; (see also Goddard's &lt;em&gt;Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Analysis, 2010&lt;/em&gt;). Wierzbicka and Goddard propose that you could theoretically explain almost all necessary concepts by building up from this set of primes, and lacking ways to express some of them will leave you incapable of expressing at least a subset of all possible topics. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.theoryland.com/intvsresults.php?kw=old+tongue" rel="noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Theoryland:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is there a complete language of the Old Tongue, and if so how long did it take you to develop it?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;ROBERT JORDAN
  There are basic 880 some words—maybe 900. I got a list of what is considered basic English—which are the 800 odd words of a basic English vocabulary. Removed the words that were of no use in the context of my world. Came up with words in the Old Tongue in each of those English words and then added those words that did have a specific context in my world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere on that page is an interview where he said this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What language is the Old Tongue based on? Gaelic, Russian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic and some additions of my own—bridging material, if you will. Grammar and syntax are a blending of English, German and Chinese, with some influences from a set of African languages, read about long ago and all but the oddities of structure long since forgotten. There are inverted constructions, for example (as in Mordero dagain pas duente cuebiyar!—literally, "Death fear none holds my heart!") and places where the article is omitted, especially where the word is a title or has gained enough importance to now incorporate the article; the absence of article indicates that it is the important or special meaning of the word that is intended. Though even then, it is not a hard and fast rule; the same inconsistencies of English are incorporated here. I am attempting to create a language which has grown, not one which was made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to be a complete enough language in terms of grammar and authentic enough for Jordan to use, though lacking in vocabulary.  From these quotes I get the feeling that he created the language well enough at one point that he didn't have to spend hours conlanging to be able to put a few sentences into his novels.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Wheel of Time Companion there was an English-Old Tongue dictionary, which is uploaded on Tor.com &lt;a href="https://www.tor.com/2016/12/20/the-wheel-of-time-english-to-old-tongue-dictionary/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  At the beginning on the website (not sure if this is also in the book as I don't have it on me) this is written:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While it is reminiscent of Tolkien’s ground-up creation of Elvish languages for The Lord of the Rings, The Old Tongue differs in that Jordan took a top-down approach, creating a dictionary of terms from which some basic suffixes, roots, and usage rules emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't bother scrolling all the way down or counting the words, but it doesn't seem to have much grammar aside from the suffixes and stuff.  Although we don't have access to this, Jordan seems to be implying that the grammar does exist.  All I could find was &lt;a href="https://library.tarvalon.net/index.php?title=Old_Tongue_Dictionary_-_English#Grammar:" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on the Tar Valon library.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Basic English&lt;/a&gt; is minimal in that it limits the number of words in the language (though not as extremely as Toki Pona). It was intended to be an international auxiliary language (although it never really caught on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language was used in 1945 in order to quickly teach Chinese sailors to understand naval orders. This was reported at the time in a &lt;a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886748,00.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Time magazine article&lt;/a&gt; (paywall beyond first two paragraphs; the reference to the article comes from Wikipedia).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;By way of introduction, this question is about a quirk of Esperanto, but there is a general conlang question at the end, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Esperanto, every root has a natural grammatical part of speech, much like how nouns have a grammatical "gender" (or noun category) in many other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, "ŝoveli" means "to shovel". It is naturally a verb. The same root with a noun ending, "ŝovelo", does not mean "a shovel". Rather, it is the noun-of-the-verb, that is, it refers to the act of shovelling. To refer to a shovel, you have to say that it's the tool of the act of shovelling, that is, "ŝovelilo".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, "humana" means "humane". It is naturally an adjective. The same root with a noun ending, "humano", does not mean "human", it is the noun-of-the-adjective, that is, "humaneness".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting design choice, and one that's puzzled me. For an Esperanto speaker, this is something you have to learn about every root, like noun classes in many IE languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any analogues to this in natural languages, or is this a device that has been used in other conlangs?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The Dwarvish language in Tolkien's legendarium is famous for being virtually unknown to non-Dwarves. Apart from a few phrases, like Gimli's battle-cry "Baruk Khazad! Khazad ai-menu!" &lt;em&gt;(from memory; please forgive the lack of diacritics)&lt;/em&gt;, almost nothing of their language is known to other Middle-Earth dwellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about us in the real world? &lt;strong&gt;Did Tolkien actually develop the language beyong those few phrases, in any of his wider notes on Middle-Earth and its languages?&lt;/strong&gt; Or did he focus more on the Elvish languages, and create the in-universe conceit of Dwarvish secretiveness just so that he didn't have to develop yet another language?&lt;/p&gt;

Khazad ai-menu!" &lt;em&gt;(from memory; please forgive the lack of diacritics)&lt;/em&gt;, almost nothing of their language is known to other Middle-Earth dwellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about us in the real world? &lt;strong&gt;Did Tolkien actually develop the language beyong those few phrases, in any of his wider notes on Middle-Earth and its languages?&lt;/strong&gt; Or did he focus more on the Elvish languages, and create the in-universe conceit of Dwarvish secretiveness just so that he didn't have to develop yet another language?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Am reading through LotR now, and have just finished H, Lost Tales, R, FG, etc. so the memories are still pretty fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ring verse is the longest bit of Black Speech, followed by Grishnákh's bit of invective towards Ugluk. Other than that, there's only a couple individual words (like &lt;em&gt;snaga&lt;/em&gt;, slave and &lt;em&gt;ghash&lt;/em&gt;, fire) to be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tolkien himself wrote as much in a letter (No. 144) to a reader of page-proofs (presumably of LotR): &lt;em&gt;...[Black Speech] only occurs in the Ring inscription, and a sentence uttered by the Orcs of Barad-Dur and in the word Nazgúl.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
A &lt;a href="https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/223148/does-the-black-speech-have-a-name/223172#223172"&gt;related query&lt;/a&gt; on the Black Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As per &lt;a href="https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/khuzdul.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; (cited by "An Analysis of Dwarvish" in Arda Philology 1: Proceedings of the First International Conference, with a very nice glossary of the language, which can be found &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=SOF7m2m3AXcC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Khuzdul+Hebrew&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EfTPPM7ME6&amp;sig=WrL_HLCEkS3mbZDCo6Y4wyLqOUA&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Khuzdul%20Hebrew&amp;f=false" rel="noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regarding Khuzdul, Tolkien stated that "this tongue has been sketched in some detail of structure, if with a very small vocabulary" (PM:300). It evidently came into being in the thirties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here PM refers to the Peoples of Middle Earth. The complete corpus of the language is described on the same site as being&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a few names, like Khazad-dûm and Zirak-zigil, the inscription on Balin's tomb, and a battle cry: Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu! "Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A petty-dwarf, Mîm, is also named, in The Children of Hurin, though that is the only reference there. The names also include Chamber of Mazarbul [records].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A complete glossary is given on the website; it is too long to copy here.) It also mentions Appendix D, E, and F in the Lord of the Rings (F primarily containing history, of course) and the Appendix in the Silmarillion also apparently contains a reference to Khuzdul:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At least one Khuzdul word made its way into Sindarin: kheled "glass", that appears in Grey-elven as heledh (see the Silmarillion Appendix, entry khelek-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This appears to be all we know of Khuzdul. In spite of this, extensive analysis has been made, with a not insignificant amount of it guesswork. See "An Analysis of Dwarvish" for one example (provides a theory of language structure). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Tolkien did state that it was "sketched", but the question is where it was - &lt;a href="http://www.lotrplaza.com/archives/index.php?Archive=archive&amp;TID=161449" rel="noreferrer"&gt;there's a chance it may be unpublished&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, there is some unpublished material concerning Khuzdul. However, it’s only a small amount, and as I recall, it consists mostly of phonological discussion, though inevitably there is in conjunction with this some discussion of the grammatical significance of various root modifications. But don’t expect anything like Etymologies or the "Early Qenya Grammar" for Khuzdul.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I agree with thrig that you would need to create something to handle this case. toki pona doesn't normally differentiate between specific sides, and this is one of those cases - there are no ways to describe "left" and "right" natively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I'm not sure thrig's examples necessarily do the job the way it needs to be done - poka wawa could work, but it implies something about strength, when that's not often what people mean by dominant and non-dominant side. And meli/mije are not used to describe strength in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I would suggest using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;poka lawa&lt;/strong&gt;: your &lt;em&gt;leading&lt;/em&gt; side. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;poka kama&lt;/strong&gt;: your &lt;em&gt;following&lt;/em&gt; side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what, though, if you use this you're going to have to indicate that you're setting it up as such in advance. You can still do this in toki pona itself: &lt;strong&gt;mi toki e ni: poka wan li poka lawa. poka tu li poka kama.&lt;/strong&gt; This sets up that you're saying one side is your poka lawa and the other side is your poka kama. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The title says it all. While I have not studied it, I have repeatedly heard that lojban is an especially "logical" language, one that could even be a way to speak a "natural" language to the computer that it can understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What feature of lojban (or features) makes this so? Is it just that humans haven't gotten to it yet?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that many speakers of Lojban use xorlo, which is a modification branching off the base language, but finding explicit information about it is difficult. What does it do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also know people are generally using it by consensus, but is xorlo an official part of the language? What happens to the original text, &lt;em&gt;The Complete Lojban Language&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xorlo is an official part of the Lojban Language.&lt;/strong&gt; The Complete Lojban Language does not contain information about xorlo, and is no longer guaranteed to be entirely accurate. The Committee for Developing Lojban (BPFK) voted 11-0 to include xorlo in the official record as a part of the Lojban language. The proposal is not finalized until the BPFK declares their work finished, but it is extremely unlikely to change, as it has become an integral part of how the language works conversationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, xorlo changes the meaning of two particle articles in lojban: lo, and le. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lo&lt;/strong&gt; as an article used to indicate that you were talking about a set of objects which are truthfully what you claim they are. Nothing about them indicates that they would be anything else. For example, "lo jgena" meant "some things that are, to our best perceptions, knots." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it doesn't say anything about perceptions, or the truthiness of what it is. It just means "any or some." It becomes the most generic article you can use in lojban, in place of anything else, because it is vague. "lo jgena" now means "any/some knot(s)," without qualification or ulterior statement about veracity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;le&lt;/strong&gt; as an article used to mean "some things I have in mind, which I am describing." For example, "le jgena" meant that you had some knots in your head. The change to le is very minor in this context, and its pure meaning hasn't actually changed. The only difference is that it now exists &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; to be used when you have &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; images of something in mind. Now, if I tell you "le jgena," you know I mean something more specific.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Tolkien was very much known to be a bit of a Luddite - no fan of technology; Treebeard says in reference to Saruman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He is plotting to become a Power. He has a mind of metal and wheels; and he does not care for growing things, except as far as they serve him for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which just about sums up his attitude towards technology. I'm curious if as a consequence words for "machine" and the like only show up in, say the Black Speech/Orcish, or if they are known to be rarely used, or derived from Khuzdul.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Lojban was designed with a few key features in mind, which are ultimately why it claims the title of "logical" language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First it's good to know that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineered_language#Logical_languages" rel="noreferrer"&gt;a logical language actually means something pretty specific&lt;/a&gt;. It's usually built on predicate logic, and a desire to express any logically-expressible statement unambiguously. No two statements are allowed to mean the same thing, and no statement is allowed to mean two things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Lojban fulfills the literal criteria for what counts as a logical language. There's also the colloquial sense, though - the way people &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; about it, when someone says "logical language."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is designed to be a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language" rel="noreferrer"&gt;regular language&lt;/a&gt;. This gives it a few key properties that make it easier for computers to process (though it's still an immensely complicated task to implement). Most of these properties are mathematical, and you can read them on the Wikipedia page. However, what it means in an intuitive way is that no word or word phrase's meaning changes based on words it's not adjacent to. That's a nice property when you're a computer and have a hard time maintaining a sense of context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lojban also has no irregular forms or rule exceptions whatsoever. All words are constructed based on specific properties that are clearly delineated, using roots that are unique and are intended to mesh with each other as-is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that any construction which can be built in a logical form can be written &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;uniquely&lt;/em&gt; in Lojban. There are no ambiguities &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; forms. Note, though, that this is commonly confused with "the language has no ambiguity." It's possible to be ambiguous in Lojban, but only intentionally, and that ambiguity is unique to the way you wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also allows for systematic, structured learning and use. New words fit into the existing grammar and structure without any other prompting, once you know what they mean and how they're used. No additional grammatical structures are needed to use any words, once you know them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mental predicates: THINK, KNOW, WANT, FEEL, SEE, HEAR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speech: SAY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actions, events, movement: DO, HAPPEN, MOVE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location, existence, specification: BE (SOMEWHERE), THERE IS, BE (SOMEONE/SOMETHING)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LA&lt;/em&gt; is clearly polysemous for THERE IS, BE (SOMEWHERE), BE (SOMEONE/SOMETHING), and probably also marks PART in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NI&lt;/em&gt; probably covers DO and MOVE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SE&lt;/em&gt; is even higher level, expressing the verb of &lt;em&gt;give&lt;/em&gt;, as well as primes like FEEL and SAY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the claim that Kēlen does not have verbs is patently false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are in fact natural languages with even more restricted verb inventories than Kēlen, such as Jingulu, which has been analysed as only have &lt;a href="https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/2219/2555"&gt;verbs for &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;come&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (I haven't seen an NSM style analysis of Jingulu, I wonder how they would see the verbs like THINK etc being expressed in Jingulu?)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In addition to Adarain’s answer, the ambiguity can also be resolved in an out-of-the-box way. For example, English can use &lt;em&gt;the former&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;the latter&lt;/em&gt; in place of an inflected form of &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; to distinguish between the two cases. Languages like German go a step further and would just use &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;the latter&lt;/em&gt; in most cases. These words do not replace pronouns, they just complement them. This gives the nice feature of preserving a possible ambiguity where it is intended for poetic or dramatic purposes while removing it entirely where clarity is desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another out-of-the-box way is to restrict the way in which such constructions can be constructed. Trying to think of how German handles the situation I realised that the sentence translated directly is unambiguous in German:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Adam hat James seinen Aufsatz geschickt, um ihm beim Schreiben zu helfen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way this can be interpreted is Adam helping James just by the way the grammar works. Adam is the sentence’s subject and the infinitive construction can only be tied to the subject. If you wanted James helping Adam, you need to work around by using a subordinate clause:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Adam hat James seinen Aufsatz geschickt, damit er ihm beim schreiben hilft.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;This answer is based largely on my copy of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Klingon_Dictionary" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Klingon Dictionary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (written by Marc Okrand, who created Klingon), which is reliable and good if you need a quick translation from English to Klingon or vice-versa. I'm going to cover most of the same ground &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/a/31/35"&gt;as rotaredom's answer&lt;/a&gt;, just in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book notes that there aren't really any greetings in Klingon; they're simply unnecessary. Klingon as a language is somewhat utilitarian in its application, and exchanges typically start with a straightforward statement or query by one party. Saying the Klingon equivalent of "How are you doing?" when you just want to figure out the new ship's departure time is simply wasteful. One answer to your question, then, would be to simply avoid a greeting. The less you talk, the less time you take up. That said, if you want to truly greet someone, you have two options. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Choice 1: Be utilitarian.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This utilitarianism is why all Klingon "greetings" are just introductory phrases. &lt;strong&gt;"nuqneH"&lt;/strong&gt; is the one that seems to be commonly used, as rotaredom said. Its translation is "What do you want?" "Nuq" itself can be treated as an interrogative sentence on its own, simply meaning "What?"&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It can also be used as the start of a sentence, such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;nuq legh yaS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which means&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What does the officer see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, "neH" is used as a form of "to want" (though it also used as an adverbial, to mean "only"). Therefore, we have the compound "nuqneH", properly an exclamation that stands by itself as a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Choice 2: Use an honorific.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Dictionary&lt;/em&gt; notes that "neS" is the only honorific suffix in Klingon, used as part of larger words. For instance, &lt;strong&gt;"qaleghneS"&lt;/strong&gt;, coming from "qa" ("you"), "legh" ("see") and "neS", translates to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am honored to see you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This states a fact, and gets to the point. It &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be used towards a superior, but this is not mandatory, and I don't think it's commonly used. If you wish to open the conversation with an inquiry, &lt;strong&gt;"HIja'neS"&lt;/strong&gt; (which includes "HIja", normally used as an affirmative) can work. Its translation is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do me the honor of telling me [about something].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, use this when asking a superior something, but only if you really want to be respectful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I have yet to see any of the following used as a greeting, I imagine you could modify them to create some sort of opening remark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"bel"&lt;/strong&gt; is the verb for "to be pleased", so when greeting someone, you could conceivably say "jIbel" ("I am pleased", with "jI" for first-person). Likewise, "Quch" is the verb for "to be happy". Using "jIbel" or "jiQuch" to indicate satisfaction upon meeting someone is a possibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"maj"&lt;/strong&gt; ("Good") or &lt;strong&gt;"majQa'"&lt;/strong&gt; ("Well done") are exclamations used as praise. You could use these - preferably "majQa'" - when welcoming an inferior who has successfully completed a task, like blowing up an enemy spaceship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"toH"&lt;/strong&gt; is another exclamation, meaning "Well!" or "So!" You would use this in, for instance, a sentence like

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well! I didn't expect to see you back alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 Appending "Daq", to make "nuqDaq", yields "Where?"&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The best parallel for Turing completeness in human languages is the &lt;a href="https://intranet.secure.griffith.edu.au/schools-departments/natural-semantic-metalanguage" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Natural Semantic Metalanguage&lt;/a&gt;. The NSM proposes that there is a limited set of basic semantic concepts which all human languages have, and which are not reducible to other concepts. They call these "semantic primes", because you combine them to get all other meanings, and because they can't be broken down. The &lt;a href="https://intranet.secure.griffith.edu.au/schools-departments/natural-semantic-metalanguage/what-is-nsm/semantic-primes" rel="noreferrer"&gt;list of primes&lt;/a&gt;, currently numbering 65, is a work in progress as new primes are proposed and evaluated, but after over 45 years of work on the theory the list has proven to be very reliable and new primes are only rarely proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSM is a good guide therefore for judging whether a conlang is "complete" - whether it would be as capable for expressing human thought as any natural language. If a conlang has vocabulary items (they can be words, affixes, or phrases) for each of the semantic primes then I would judge it to be complete.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;The best parallel for Turing completeness in human languages is the &lt;a href="https://intranet.secure.griffith.edu.au/schools-departments/natural-semantic-metalanguage" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Natural Semantic Metalanguage&lt;/a&gt;. The NSM proposes that there is a limited set of basic semantic concepts which all human languages have, and which are not reducible to other concepts. They call these "semantic primes", because you combine them to get all other meanings, and because they can't be broken down. The &lt;a href="https://intranet.secure.griffith.edu.au/schools-departments/natural-semantic-metalanguage/what-is-nsm/semantic-primes" rel="noreferrer"&gt;list of primes&lt;/a&gt;, currently numbering 65, is a work in progress as new primes are proposed and evaluated, but after over 45 years of work on the theory the list has proven to be very reliable and new primes are only rarely proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSM is a good guide therefore for judging whether a conlang is "complete" - whether it would be as capable for expressing human thought as any natural language. If a conlang has vocabulary items (they can be words, affixes, or phrases) for each of the semantic primes then I would judge it to be complete.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;What is meant by "logical language", is that the language's grammar is engineered so that any statement you make is &lt;em&gt;syntactically&lt;/em&gt; unambiguous. Grammatically correct statements only parse one way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In natural languages, and many constructed languages, the meaning of a statement can be interpreted to be a number of things, depending on context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example to given in the "Complete Lojban Language" book (CLL), is the term "Pretty Little Girls’ School". In English, there's no way to tell what this means. Does it mean a school for "pretty little girls", a pretty school for "little girls", or a small school that is pretty and for girls?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lojban's grammar is such that the relationship between words is unambiguous. The meaning to words themselves doesn't matter all too much to the language's designers, just the relation between those words. As such, ambiguity is still possible, but usually in the form of semantic vagueness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it's not like there's only one way to say anything. According to the CLL, there are &lt;a href="https://lojban.github.io/cll/5/16/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forty&lt;/strong&gt; ways&lt;/a&gt; to translate the English phrase "Pretty Little Girls' School" into Lojban. Among them, is &lt;code&gt;melbi cmalu nixli ckule&lt;/code&gt;, which would be a direct translation of the English phrase, word-for-word, and refer a "school for girls who are beautifully small". Whatever "beautifully small" means.&lt;br&gt;
But if you go through the list of possible interpretations, you'll notice that there are in fact some statements that evaluate to the same meaning, either because that's how the semantics work out, or because the two statements can be logically equivalent. (&lt;code&gt;2 + 2 = 4&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;2 × 2 = 4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;2² = 4&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these properties are what make Lojban a tempting tool to use for communicating with AI, who are notoriously bad at working out vague context we use in everyday speech. And it's also why Lojban is called a "Logical Language".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;By definition, a syllabary has separate glyphs for each possible syllable (and usually unrelated or at least not systematically related ones for similar syllables, unlike alphasyllabaries). This obviously clashes in practicality with having complex syllable structure, leading to a large amount of possible syllables and therefore a large amount of symbols. How can this conflict be dealt with? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've read that some work has been done on the script, indicating that there are patterns, even if we don't know what they are referring to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a copy of V.M. (a book èvery glossopoet should have!). I'm frankly of the opinion that, considering the size of the book and the cost of the materials in it and the cost in time to produce the work, it can't just be 240some pages of random nonsense. It's too expensive and would be an incredible, inconceivable waste of resources if it were just a meaningless &amp; private toy of some overly rich maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each page of vellum requires a relatively labour intensive process to make. Inks have to be made. Each page has to be hand written and hand drawn. Some pages are really large fold-outs.  Almost every page is decorated in some way. That's a lot of work for it be nothing at all but a pretty conversation piece!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The best solution to this is to not make your writing system syllabic if your language does not support the syllabic structure by having a low number of syllables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that one of the most commonly cited examples of a syllabic writing system is the Japanese katakana/hiragana system. Japanese phonology fits these systems &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well because syllables are basically (C(y))V with the principal exception of syllabic &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; and the secondary one of ‘double consonants’ (まって — matte). Therefore, Japanese needs only around 50 distinct symbols for its syllabary. It made perfect sense to simplify complex Chinese characters to a reduced form carrying just a phonetic information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, languages such as German or English would be terrible choices for inventing a syllabary. Their syllable structures have very little constraints at all; basically anything is possible. Coming up with a syllabary would require many hundreds if not thousands of characters — to the point where it would be simpler and more consistent to create an ideographic writing system instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example &lt;em&gt;to write&lt;/em&gt;. In a syllabary, the symbol for &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;I write&lt;/em&gt; would be the same as in &lt;em&gt;right (there)&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;you are right.&lt;/em&gt; But then if you take &lt;em&gt;I wrote&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;wrote&lt;/em&gt; would be something completely different (yet with the same symbol as &lt;em&gt;rote memorisation,&lt;/em&gt; I think?). &lt;em&gt;I have written&lt;/em&gt; would use two symbols, neither of which has anything to do with the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an alphabetic or alphasyllabic system, there would at least be some visual resemblence between all those forms allowing for recognition. That’s also why English benefits from its extremely irregular (based on phonetics) spelling: meanings can be recognised based on writing and words with similar meanings are written similarly. Their common root is retained in a common spelling which is not possible in a pure syllabary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A language’s writing system will either have been developed by the language itself or have been copied and adapted from geographically close languages. Of course, it would be possible for a Germanic-type language with a highly variable syllable structure to adapt a syllabic writing system initially — but it is very highly likely that it will soon be improved in numerous ways until an actually working alternative has been found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of thinking how you can bring the two ends together, I would propose you think of which writing system actually makes sense for your language.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Here are some ideas, which when taken together would give a good idea whether a language has a strong functional speech community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a conlang has thousands of fluent first language (L1) speakers, that would be clear evidence, but even Esperanto, the most spoken conlang, has only &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Esperanto_speakers" rel="noreferrer"&gt;up to 1000 Esperanto speaking families&lt;/a&gt;. Ideally those L1 speakers are able to meet and speak with each other regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if the speakers are second language speakers, if there are so many speakers that distinct dialects have formed (without that being part of the design from the beginning) then that evidence of language change is evidence itself of healthy speech communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is friction between speakers of the language and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_language_regulators#Auxiliary_languages" rel="noreferrer"&gt;language's academy or regulators&lt;/a&gt; then that shows the language is starting to take on a life of its own. If the language regulators have ever had to make concessions to the speakers, then that shows the speech community is healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;For varying definitions of "conlang", yes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The very most obvious example is &lt;strong&gt;Esperanto&lt;/strong&gt; with a well-documented native speaker community. It has received limited official recognition, the most interesting of which currently seems to be PR of China's &lt;a href="http://esperanto.china.org.cn/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El Popola Ĉinio&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://esperanto.cri.cn/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;China Radio International&lt;/em&gt; in Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;. There are many more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A less obvious example would be &lt;strong&gt;Classical Sanskrit&lt;/strong&gt;, which was, arguably, constructed by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pāṇini&lt;/a&gt;, and is a &lt;a href="http://www.languageinindia.com/nov2001/1991Languages.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Scheduled Language of India&lt;/a&gt; with some fifty thousand people speaking it in 1991; it is furthermore an official language of the Indian state of &lt;a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/sanskrit-is-second-official-language-in-uttarakhand/story-wxk51l8Re4vNxofrr7FAJK.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Uttarakhand&lt;/a&gt;, and reportedly the language of the majority in a village called &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/This-village-speaks-gods-language/articleshow/1199965.cms" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Mathoor&lt;/a&gt;. It is used across all levels of education across India.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A more &lt;em&gt;controversial&lt;/em&gt; example would be &lt;strong&gt;Modern Hebrew&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the few successfully revived language in modern times. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revival_of_the_Hebrew_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;page on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; gives a solid overview of the situation, and is fairly unbiased. Of the three mentioned here, Hebrew is arguably the most successful "graduated" language — if you consider it a conlang to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it reflects, if anything, more on Lovecraft's lack of linguistic understanding than anything about the language of the Old Ones, since the roots in human languages get pretty damn ridiculous, so it's really hard to imagine something "utterly unlike any found in human languages". You would have to design a phonology produced by speech organs completely unlike those of humans to approach this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I to tackle this, I would go for a system not unlike Arabic, but where the root is constituted of a set of &lt;em&gt;vowels&lt;/em&gt; instead (with maybe "consonant harmony"?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, Mark Rosenfelder's &lt;a href="http://www.zompist.com/kebreni.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Kebreni&lt;/a&gt; has roots where vowels are swapped around a whole lot, and I doubt that metathesis as a base derivational system exists in any human language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, I'm not sure designing something literally outside the boundaries of what the human mind can handle is by definition possible, which is what Lovecraft truly was after in his poor description attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ancientscripts.com/linearb.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Linear B&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting example for this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This system was apparently designed for a non-Greek language, as it did not fit the sounds of Greek very well. In fact, it is likely that Linear A was used to write the pre-Greek language of Crete, and the incoming Greeks adopted this writing system for their own use, but without changing how the system fundamentally works. In doing so, they developed "spelling conventions" to represent sound patterns found in Greek but not in the syllabary.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;First, there are many Greek sounds that are missing in Linear B signs, such as [g], [kh], [gw], [b], [ph], [th], and [l]. To solve this problem, signs for similar sounds are used instead: p-signs are used for [p], [b], and [ph]; k-signs are used for [k], [g], and [kh]; t-signs are used for [t] and [th]; q-signs are used for [kw] and [gw]; and r-signs are used for [r] and [l]. However, while this convention was likely easily understood by ancient Mycenaean scribes, it took modern scholars a lot of theoretical analysis and work, plus comparison with later Greek dialects and reconstructed Mycenaean words to rediscover how this system works&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more relevantly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Another inadequacy stems from the fact that Linear B signs usually represent Consonant-Vowel (CV) syllables, but the syllabic structure of Greek allows initial consonant clusters, ending consonants, and dipthongs. In the case of a syllable with a initial consonant cluster, individual consonants in the cluster are written by a CV sign whose vowel matches the vowel of the syllable. Therefore, for example, the word tri is written as ti-ri, and khrusos as ku-ru-so. In the case of ending consonant, the situation becomes more complicated. Ending consonants such as [l], [m], [n], [r], and [s] are not usually written, whereas other consonants such as [k] and [p] are written in a way similar to initial consonants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one way to represent consonant clusters in a syllabary is to pick a "dummy vowel" that gets read over when the word is pronounced, as in Linear B, or Japanese katakana when writing foreign words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question doesn't mention just how complex the syllable structure is; if it's not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; complex, you can also do what Japanese hiragana does with the ん character and have a single character that represents a syllable-ending consonant. Or something like what &lt;a href="http://www.ancientscripts.com/brahmi.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Brahmi&lt;/a&gt; does for vowels and nasals, adding strokes and dots to represent them. Maybe if &lt;em&gt;kra&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tra&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;pra&lt;/em&gt; are common syllables in your language, you could have a stroke that represents an &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; between the consonant and vowel, and add it to the characters for &lt;em&gt;ka&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ta&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;pa&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In general, we don't want to make descriptions so long and complicated as to be difficult to follow. That is more important than exact word count, in my experience (as an admin of the "toki pona taso" group on Facebook). For example, if someone mentioned a "poki kala suli pi telo ala", I wouldn't find that at all strange as a description of an empty aquarium. However, if someone spoke of an "ilo sona lili pakala laso", I'd probably have to read it a few times to figure out what they're talking about (in this case I'm thinking of a dysfunctional blue laptop). So compounds with "pi" tend to have a bit more leeway because that groups the words together somewhat, making it easier to decipher. But shorter, simpler descriptions are generally preferred, and in practice this usually does turn out to be three words or less.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One popular proposal that comes up in a lot of discussions on this topic is to base it on the direction of the official writing system (i.e. Latin characters). Thus "poki open" for left, and "poki pini" for right. However, there is still no real consensus on how to say "right" and "left", so these expressions might not be understood by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovio" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Slovio (from the Slavic word "slovo") is a constructed language begun in 1999 by Mark Hučko. Hučko claims that the language should be relatively easy for non-Slavs to learn as well, as an alternative to languages such as Esperanto which are based more on Latin...&lt;br&gt;
  [...]&lt;br&gt;
  Slovio has a relatively simple grammar based on a mix of Esperanto grammar with Slavic elements. Just like in natural Slavic languages, new words can be formed with a variety of suffixes and prefixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not familiar with Slovio or Esperanto at all. How much is Slovio based on Esperanto? Does it just take some parts of the grammar, or does it go to a further extant than that?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In terms of the vocabulary, not much is based on Esperanto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.slovio.com/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the Slovio website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esperanto?&lt;/strong&gt; While Esperanto is a simple language its main problem is the fact that it is made up of too many unrelated languages and thus, if you speak Esperanto, no-one will understand you only other Esperantists. On the other hand Slovio, since it is made up of only closely related Slavic languages, can be put to an immediate use. Using Slovio, you will be understood by some 400 million people, most of whom have never ever heard of Slovio, but who will understand you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it looks like the only inspiration Slovio has taken from Esperanto is the grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.slovio.com/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the Slovio website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esperanto?&lt;/strong&gt; While Esperanto is a simple language its main problem is the fact that it is made up of too many unrelated languages and thus, if you speak Esperanto, no-one will understand you only other Esperantists. On the other hand Slovio, since it is made up of only closely related Slavic languages, can be put to an immediate use. Using Slovio, you will be understood by some 400 million people, most of whom have never ever heard of Slovio, but who will understand you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it looks like the only inspiration Slovio has taken from Esperanto is the grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Usually, constructed languages of all kind (naturalistic or not) draw their sounds from existing natural languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there conlangs with &lt;em&gt;constructed sounds&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., sounds that do not occur in natural languages (or are at least very rare in natural languages)?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting aspects of Interlingua is that during its early days there were a number of scientific articles published in it. This is in contrast with most other constructed languages, which are primarily used to publish things that are of interest only to their own communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have other constructed languages been used for that purpose?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://ithkuil.net/01_phonology.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Ithkuil&lt;/a&gt;, a geminate /h/ can be produced as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_bidental_fricative" rel="noreferrer"&gt;bidental fricative&lt;/a&gt;, a sound which is only attested in a single dialect of a single natural language.&lt;/p&gt;

This second allophone should not be employed if the resulting pharyngealization distorts the timbre of the adjacent vowels to the extent that their place of articulation changes (e.g., the vowel &lt;strong&gt;û&lt;/strong&gt; being made to sound like &lt;strong&gt;ô&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Creating a logographic writing system for a language can quickly become overwhelming; having a different symbol/image for each word can quickly become overwhelming; it’s why Sequoyah switched to a syllabary instead of a logogram. The more words there are in a language the more symbols there have to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are historically successful uses of logograms - for instance, Egyptian hieroglyphics and Chinese (when it first started). I’m not aware of any modern natural language that actually uses a logographic system as its primary writing system, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would a conlang use a logographic writing system after the language grew to any extant? Would it be possible to create a conlang that actually uses a sustainable logographic system?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Many sources say that Tolkien's Dwarvish resembles the Hebrew language.  The &lt;a href="http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Khuzdul" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lord of the Rings Wikia&lt;/a&gt; states that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It appears to be structured, like real-world Semitic languages, around the triconsonantal roots: kh-z-d, b-n-d, z-g-l.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, from &lt;a href="https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/khuzdul.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;folk.uib.no&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The basic structure of Khuzdul resembles that of Semitic languages, like Arabic and Hebrew. The stems from which words are derived are not by themselves pronounceable words, but consist of consonants only. Nouns, verbs, adjectives etc. are derived not only by prefixes and suffixes (if such devices are used at all), but also by inserting certain vowels between these consonants, sometimes also by doubling one of the consonants. Often the words are actually inflected by internal vowel-changes instead of adding affixes: Rukhs means "Orc", but plural "Orcs" is Rakhâs. The root consonants - the so-called radicals - remain the same, like *R-Kh-S in this case. In Khuzdul as well as in Semitic languages, there are usually three radicals in the root; several such roots are mentioned in TI:174 and RS:466: B-R-Z "red", B-N-D "head", K-B-L "silver", N-R-G "black". An example of a biconsonantal root is Z-N "dark, dim" (RS:466).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baruk Khazâd!&lt;/strong&gt; is said to mean "Axes of the Dwarves!" Baruk is usually taken to be an example of something similar to the Hebrew "construct state": the state a word is said to be in when it is placed in front of a noun to express a genitival relationship: X Y meaning "X of Y" or "Y's X". (Compare Hebrew סוס (sûs) "horse", המלך (hammelekh) "the king", סוס המלך (sûs hammelekh) "the king's horse, the horse of the king".) Of course, we cannot be certain that baruk is the normal plural "axes" and not a specialized form meaning "axes of". It may be significant that all the other attested plurals contain a long vowel: Khazâd "Dwarves", Rakhâs "Orcs", tarâg "beards", shathûr "clouds", ûl "streams", dûm "excavations, halls", bizâr "valleys". Could the normal plural "axes" be *barûk? Shathûr "clouds" may represent a plural pattern in -a-û-. In Hebrew, the vowels of words in the construct state are often shortened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it actually based on Hebrew / Semitic languages, or is that simply an impression?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Yes.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.reocities.com/Area51/Shire/5014/interview.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this interview with Tolkien&lt;/a&gt;, he really did design it to be Semitic.  He says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The dwarves of course are quite obviously,  wouldn't you say that in many ways they remind you of the Jews? Their words are Semitic obviously, constructed to be Semitic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, he did design their tongue to be very like the Semitic language, possibly since their history resembled that of the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In addition to the options mentioned by Adarain and Jan, various &lt;strong&gt;reflexives&lt;/strong&gt; and reflexive-like operations can often be of use in dealing with such situations. English already has some reflexives, providing some amount of disambiguation, Danish goes a little further has a compulsory reflexive/non-reflexive distinction in 3rd person possessives, and while the specific example you mentioned doesn't work well in translation, a similarly problematic sentence "Adam sent James his essay" can be easily somewhat disambiguated with this system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Adam&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; sendte James&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;strong&gt;sin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; stil&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Adam&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; sendte James&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;strong&gt;hans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j(/k)&lt;/sub&gt; stil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible for reflexive systems to be significantly more broad than this, rather than just referring to antecedents in the same clause, even if it's omitted via some other rule, e.g. in &lt;em&gt;"Jonh saw Adam and shot &lt;strong&gt;himself&lt;/strong&gt; in the foot"&lt;/em&gt;, where there is no overt reference to John in the second clause, because it's been omitted due to subject coreference (such deletion rules, when constraints are put on them is actually another way of reducing ambiguity, I have relatively recently written &lt;a href="http://aveneca.com/cbb/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;p=272613#p272613" rel="noreferrer"&gt;a rather long forum post&lt;/a&gt; on this which goes into much more detail about them), it's possible to have "&lt;strong&gt;long-distance reflexives&lt;/strong&gt;" which take antecedents outside of the clause. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mandarin, the reflexive &lt;em&gt;ziji&lt;/em&gt; can refer to both local and non-local antecedents in some cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Zhangsan renwei Lisi kan-bu-qi ziji&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;Zhangsan think Lisi look-not-up REFL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"Zhangsan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; thinks Lisi&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; looks down on self&lt;sub&gt;&lt;strong&gt;i/j&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain things block this though, for example shifts in perspective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Zhangsan renwei wo zhidao Wangwu xihuan ziji&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;Zhangsan think I know Wangwu like REFL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"Zhangsan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; thinks I&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; know Wangwu&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; likes self&lt;sub&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*i/*j/k&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Igbo, in complements of communication, entities that are coreferential with the source of information are marked by what is known as "&lt;strong&gt;logophoric pronouns&lt;/strong&gt;":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ọ́  sị̀rị̀ nà   ọ́  byàrà&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;he said that he came&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; came"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;ọ́  sị̀rị̀ nà   yá  byàrà&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;he said that LOG came&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; came"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gokana also has such a system, though the marking is on the verb, though the constraints on what can be coreferential are quite free:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;aè kɔ aè dɔ&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;he said he fell&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; fell"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;aè kɔ aè dɔ-ɛ&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;he said he fell-LOG&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; fell"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;aè kɔ oò div-èè e&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;he said you hit-LOG him&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that you hit him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;aè kɔ oò ziv-èè a gĩ́ã́&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;he said you stole-LOG his yams&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that you stole his&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; yams"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logophoricity" rel="noreferrer"&gt;The wikipedia article on logophoricity&lt;/a&gt; goes into more depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to have two different reflexives, requiring respectively local and non-local antecedents. Danish has a rather limited case of this in bare complements to perception verbs, where the two reflexives &lt;em&gt;sig&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sig selv&lt;/em&gt; which are usually either only different in level of emphasis or in complementary distribution, respectively require non-local and local antecedents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Holger hørte Peter tale om sig.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"Holger&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; heard Peter&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; talking about him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Holger hørte Peter tale om sig selv.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"Holger&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; heard Peter&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; talking about himself&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Holger hørte Peter tale om ham.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"Holger&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; heard Peter&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; talking about him&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"4th Person systems"&lt;/strong&gt; such as seen Eskimo languages are rather similar, though more general as they are used in all subordinate clauses are also another type of reflexive-like construction (the "fourth" person is often labeled 3R) and they are also used intraclausally in possessive marking. In all of these cases they mark that a participant or possessor is coreferential with the subject of the main clause (which is defined in terms of S/A despite the case marking being ergative). An example from &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lB-Izi_GRc15obQHG3fUni-_T6ZHifqJ/view" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Siberian Yupik&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;esghaghyagu quyaaq&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;see:CNSQ:3s&gt;3s happy:IND.3s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"when he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, he&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; was happy"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;esghaghyamigu quyaaq&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;see:CNSQ:3Rs&gt;3s happy:IND.3s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"when he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; was happy"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;esghaghyatni quyaaq&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;see:CNSQ:3s&gt;3Rs happy:IND.3s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"when he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; was happy"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to all these various reflexive constructions, &lt;strong&gt;switch reference&lt;/strong&gt;, the overt marking of whether the "subject" is either the same or different, either between two coordinate clauses, or a subordinate and main clause can also resolve some ambiguity. Take for example this pair of sentences from Hua:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ebgi-Ø-na korihie&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;hit-SAME-3sg.ANTICSU ran.away.3sg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; hit him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ran away"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;ebgi-ga-na korihie&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;hit-3sg.DIFF-3sg.ANTICSU ran.away.3sg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; hit him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; ran away"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switch reference can only deal with one set of coreference though what exactly is tracked varies. In some languages, it is specifically the actor that is tracked, while others may track the topic or some other pragmatically prominent NP, or may even differ in what is tracked in the controlling clause as opposed to the clause recieving the marking. Additionally the marking may occasionally also be sensitive to changes in things like time, place, discourse coherency and/or reality status, and as a result, switch reference may fulfill may other roles than simply dealing with ambiguity. &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2hgQLVtMsqZMWt2YlZFTHpKR0E" rel="noreferrer"&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt;, particularly chapters 5 and 6, goes into quite a bit of detail about the highly varied and interesting usage of switch-ref in Papua New Guinean languages.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The problem with pure logographies is that languages tend to have a significant amount of morphemes, be these bound or free, that mark relatively abstract concepts, such as posession, the roles of NPs, etc., and some abstract words are rather hard to draw symbols for. As such, a purely logographic system cannot really deal with natural languages to their full extent, and therefore pick up "impurities", not just out of convenience, but out of necessity, since without them they are generally at best mnemonic aids and not a full (or almost full) representation of the spoken language. If you want a pure logographic system to be realistically viable for your conlang, going the oligomorphemic route, like Toki Pona, is probably the most reasonable, as the low number of morphemes reduces the strain of learning a large number of symbols, as well as the issue of coming up with new ones for new or rarely written-about concepts, since morphemes are a closed class, and the necessarily relatively general meaning of these morphemes means that it would likely be relatively straightforward to represent the majority of them with mostly intuitive iconography.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The Occidental magazine &lt;a href="http://cosmoglotta.blogspot.com.au" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cosmoglotta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; occasionally published scientific articles.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 32nd publication of Cosmoglotta, a &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ym9KW.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;"supplement"&lt;/a&gt; was added to the magazine, stating that it was "necessary to use the language not only in linguistics articles".

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Quenya has &lt;strong&gt;tanwë&lt;/strong&gt; which means "device, craft, construction."  A search for "machine" on this site which may or may not be reputable gives a couple of other words in Quenya, Sindarin, and Noldorin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tolkien did once use the word &lt;strong&gt;gun&lt;/strong&gt; in the Hobbit.  &lt;a href="https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/76397/the-use-of-the-word-gun-in-the-hobbit"&gt;This question&lt;/a&gt; on sff explains that, and the top answer to it includes this quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Common Speech, as the language of the Hobbits and their narratives, has inevitably been turned into modern English. In the process the difference between the varieties observable in the use of the Westron has been lessened. Some attempt has been made to represent these varieties by variations in the kind of English used ... (LOTR: The Return of the King, Appendix F, "II. On Translation")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend reading the entire answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it seems that, logically, there should be no words for "future" technologies in Middle earth; any translation of them by Tolkien can be explained as Tolkien trying to make it easier for us to understand.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other point I want to bring up is that many of the words found in modern Quenya dictionaries are not original creations by Tolkien, but derivations from his notes.  I doubt he created these words intentionally to violate the technology level of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Black Speech, we have only a very limited number of words, as seen here; in Dwarvish, as you pointed out in your own answer here, Tolkien has a very limited vocabulary, and only one word has been borrowed from Khuzdul into the Elvish languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the quote you have about Sauron being a robot is not literal--the orcs' tehnology was no more advanced than the men and the elves'.  I'm sure that "mind of metal and wheels" is meant to be some Entish idiom that references being hasty.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt; and watching &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; are two different experiences. One difference that pops out to me is the language that the Dothraki speak, known by the same name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally the show seems to include much more of the language than the books do, as you need to have actors speak aloud for the audience to interact, where as in writing you can have the audience see the thoughts of the character. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has me wondering how much of the language George R. R. Martin had developed prior to the production of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and/or how much was created for/by the show?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The majority of Dothraki was indeed created for the show.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George has stated the he is not quite a linguist in that sense (comparing himself against Tolkien). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don't have a whole imaginary language in my desk here, the way Tolkien did.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Tolkien was a philologist, and an Oxford don, and could spend decades laboriously inventing Elvish in all its detail. I, alas, am only a hardworking SF and fantasy novel, and I don't have his gift for languages. That is to say, I have not actually created a Valyrian language. The best I could do was try to sketch in each of the chief tongues of my imaginary world in broad strokes, and give them each their characteristic sounds and spelling.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1250/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;So Spake Martin, YET MORE QUESTIONS, July 22, 2001&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He mostly just makes words as needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"DO YOU HAVE THE LANGUAGES ALL PLANNED OUT?"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;No he'll make up a word here and there but he does NOT have the whole language written.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Boskone_Boston_MA_February_14_161" rel="noreferrer"&gt;So Spake Martin, BOSKONE (BOSTON, MA), February 14,2003&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even going as far to say that now he will have refer to the creator of the language for the show in his future writing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of course, he then added that with HBO having created Dothraki through the work of David J. Peterson, he feels like now if he wants to have Dothraki (and Valyrian as well) he'll have to refer to Peterson's work to get it "right", or ask Peterson himself how to say something in Dothraki.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Stockholm_and_Archipelacon_Report" rel="noreferrer"&gt;So Spake Martin, STOCKHOLM AND ARCHIPELACON REPORT, June 28, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://dothraki.conlang.org/official-hbo-press-release/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;show selected&lt;/a&gt; David J. Peterson, an expert language creator from the Language Creation Society to create Dothraki for &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Peterson drew inspiration from George R.R. Martin’s description of the language, as well as from such languages as Russian, Turkish, Estonian, Inuktitut and Swahili. However, the Dothraki language is no mere hodgepodge, babble or pidgin. It has its own unique sound, an extensive vocabulary of more than 1,800 words and a complex grammatical structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which as of September 21, 2011 has over &lt;a href="http://www.dothraki.com/2011/09/the-header-script/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;3,000 words&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Also, for the curious, Dothraki is now up to 3,163 words: More words than Mr. Padre Tony Gwynn has hits, but still a ways to go to catch Pete Rose (and my guess is Dothraki will have double his number before he gets even a sniff of the Hall of Fame).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even going as far to say that now he will have refer to the creator of the language for the show in his future writing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of course, he then added that with HBO having created Dothraki through the work of David J. Peterson, he feels like now if he wants to have Dothraki (and Valyrian as well) he'll have to refer to Peterson's work to get it "right", or ask Peterson himself how to say something in Dothraki.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Stockholm_and_Archipelacon_Report" rel="noreferrer"&gt;So Spake Martin, STOCKHOLM AND ARCHIPELACON REPORT, June 28, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://dothraki.conlang.org/official-hbo-press-release/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;show selected&lt;/a&gt; David J. Peterson, an expert language creator from the Language Creation Society to create Dothraki for &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Peterson drew inspiration from George R.R. Martin’s description of the language, as well as from such languages as Russian, Turkish, Estonian, Inuktitut and Swahili. However, the Dothraki language is no mere hodgepodge, babble or pidgin. It has its own unique sound, an extensive vocabulary of more than 1,800 words and a complex grammatical structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which as of September 21, 2011 has over &lt;a href="http://www.dothraki.com/2011/09/the-header-script/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;3,000 words&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Also, for the curious, Dothraki is now up to 3,163 words: More words than Mr. Padre Tony Gwynn has hits, but still a ways to go to catch Pete Rose (and my guess is Dothraki will have double his number before he gets even a sniff of the Hall of Fame).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Well, y'know, ANADEW and all that, but...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, there is no natural language with a grammaticalized &lt;em&gt;antiperfect&lt;/em&gt; aspect--i.e., an aspect where the time of the action is &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the reference point, rather than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present Perfect: "He has come."
Past Perfect (pluperfect): "He had come."
Future Perfect: "He will have come."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each case, the event occurs before the reference time defined by the tense. In the case of future perfect, this may or may not be before the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An antiperfect flips that around&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present Antiperfect: "He is going to come." / "He is about to come."
 (approximately)
Past Antiperfect: "He was going to come." / "He was about to come."
 (approximately)
Future Antiperfect: "He will be going to come." / "He will be about to come." (approximately)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various English paraphrases all have some extraneous additional implications (e.g., "He was going to come" implies that he didn't actually, "about to" implies that the action is nearby) that are not inherent to the antiperfect aspect, if it were grammaticalized. The important thing is that the action occurs after the reference time, but not necessarily after the present. Thus, just like a future perfect action &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have occurred in the past, a past antiperfect &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; occur in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Let's first take note that no actual Turing-complete machine has ever been built, nor can one ever be built. Modern computers are good enough approximations for most purposes, but they are in reality just very large finite state machines. A true Turing machine requires &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; storage space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infinite storage space of the Turing machine model is mirrored in the (computationally equivalent) lambda calculus by the capacity to define an infinite number of arbitrarily-named variables. This suggests a natural connection to human languages: the potentially-infinite set of variables in lambda calculus corresponds to the set of &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; in a human language, while human grammars correspond to the reduction rules of lambda calculus. Transferring that back to the Turing machine model, the infinite storage tape of a Turing machine corresponds to the potential vocabulary of a human language, while the state transition rules correspond to a grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the first thing you need to make a human language "Turing complete"--capable of referring to or describing &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; that can be referred to or described--is an infinite vocabulary! That's clearly impossible, but like real computers approximate Turing machines, we can approximate a "Turing complete conlang" simply by ensuring there is some way to create new lexical items--either strictly by as-needed de-novo coinage, or oligosynthesis, or whatever other word-formation techniques you like--and then abstract away from the vocabulary and looking at the &lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt; for how that vocabulary is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing the analogy, the fact that there are two such radically different formulations for computation that are nevertheless provably identical in expressive power (the lambda calculus and Turing machine--and, in fact, even more different formalisms than that, like the SKI combinator calculus, NAND machines and the One Instruction Set Computer, etc.) suggests that there may not be any &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; simplest set of grammar constructs that make an abstract language "complete".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empirically, however, if you put stock in David Gil's work on so-called IMA (Isolating-Monocategorial-Associative) language, the only necessary &lt;em&gt;and sufficient&lt;/em&gt; requirement for effective human communication (or as he puts it, enough grammar "to sail a boat") is the existence of a generic "association operator"--a way to say "the things represented by these two sub-phrases are related somehow"--and literally everything else can be handled by pragmatics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you need the ability to introduce whatever words you find that you need in a given situation, and you need at least one operator that can specify arbitrary relations between things (e.g., the generic English preposition "of")--which could have a surface expression as simple as juxtaposition. Everything else is sugar, that just makes figuring out the pragmatic details easier.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;According to magazine author Arika Okrent in "Discouraging Words" from &lt;em&gt;Failure Magazine&lt;/em&gt; (July 21, 2009), it's Esperanto.  She writes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the most widely used invented language?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Definitely Esperanto, which is ironic because when you say “Esperanto,” most people say, “Didn’t that die out in the 1920s?” Or, “Esperanto? That failed utopian project?” But in terms of invented languages, it’s the most outlandishly successful invented language ever. It has thousands of speakers—even native speakers—and that’s a major accomplishment as compared to the 900 or so other languages that have no speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not hard to believe either.  According to &lt;a href="http://www.esperanto.net/veb/faq-5.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Esperanto.net&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Professor Sidney S. Culbert of the University of Washington, Seattle, USA, has done the most comprehensive survey on language use ever attempted. He has conducted interviews in dozens of countries around the world and tested for "professional proficiency", i.e. much more than just "hello, please, goodbye".&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Based on this survey, Prof. Culbert concluded that Esperanto has about two million speakers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this doesn't &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; answer your question, since it was specifically about published literature.  However, according to &lt;a href="https://esperanto.stackexchange.com/a/1129"&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt; on the Esperanto stack, there are probably around 200 novels that were originally published in Esperanto, along with 400 volumes of short stories - &lt;em&gt;and that's in the fiction category only.&lt;/em&gt;  There's a list of Esperanto libraries &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_library" rel="noreferrer"&gt;on wikapedia&lt;/a&gt;, some of which have thousands of works in them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;There's no evidence to say that it is a constructed language.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea was investigated in detail by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tiltman" rel="noreferrer"&gt;John Tiltman&lt;/a&gt;, a British army officer who specialized in cryptography. The possibility of the Voynich manuscript being a constructed language was brought to his attention by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Friedman" rel="noreferrer"&gt;William Friedman&lt;/a&gt;, an expert on the manuscript. Friedman confided to Tiltman, after decades of work on it, that he thought the writing could be a form of "synthetic universal language", and so the cryptographer expanded his investigation in that direction, &lt;a href="https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/tech-journals/assets/files/voynich-manuscript-mysterious.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;writing a paper on the theory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic premise behind a "synthetic universal language" is to use characters to represent certain logical ideas; by chaining together letters, you can create "words" that describe more complicated principles. By adding the appropriate prefixes and suffixes, characters can be quite powerful. Tiltman noticed that some of the patterns in the words fit this type of design. However, the evidence for this sort of construction was not strong enough, and Tiltman's analysis of the frequency of the occurrence of certain letters did not support Friedman's hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiltman also traced the historical origin of a "universal language", to determine if such an idea had been bounced around early enough. However, this proved difficult, and Tiltman found no concrete examples prior to the mid-17th century. This is two centuries after the Voynich manuscript was written - sometime in the 15th century - and so &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the manuscript was indeed written in a universal language, it would predate these universal languages by two centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiltman noted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was clear that the productions of these two men [Wilkins and Dalgarno, two early proponents of universal languages] were much too systematic, and anything of the kind would have been almost instantly recognisable. My analysis seemed to me to reveal a cumbersome mixture of different kinds of substitution. When I was
  attempting to trace back the idea of universal language, I came upon a printed book entitled The Universal Character by Cave Beck, London 1657 (also printed in French in the same year). Cave Beck was one of the original members of the British Royal Society and his system was certainly a cumbersome mixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beck's writing claims that the idea of a universal language goes back to the 16th century, but this still places it many years after the manuscript's origin.  The idea of synthetic universal languages, though perhaps relatively widespread in the 17th century, simply was unknown in the 15th. This was a strike against Friedman's theory. If the Voynich manuscript was a synthetic universal language, it would have borne no relation - in time of conception of structure - to later examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The universal language route is of course not the only possibility; constructed languages can take many forms. However, it was possible the most promising option, and research into it went nowhere. Friedman's claim remains unsupported, and, to my knowledge, no further academic analyses have been done. We certainly can't rule out the theory that the Voynich manuscript is written in a constructed language, but we have no reason to believe that it is.&lt;/p&gt;

The possibility of the Voynich manuscript being a constructed language was brought to his attention by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Friedman" rel="noreferrer"&gt;William Friedman&lt;/a&gt;, an expert on the manuscript. Friedman confided to Tiltman, after decades of work on it, that he thought the writing could be a form of "synthetic universal language", and so the cryptographer expanded his investigation in that direction, &lt;a href="https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/tech-journals/assets/files/voynich-manuscript-mysterious.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;writing a paper on the theory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic premise behind a "synthetic universal language" is to use characters to represent certain logical ideas; by chaining together letters, you can create "words" that describe more complicated principles. By adding the appropriate prefixes and suffixes, characters can be quite powerful. Tiltman noticed that some of the patterns in the words fit this type of design. However, the evidence for this sort of construction was not strong enough, and Tiltman's analysis of the frequency of the occurrence of certain letters did not support Friedman's hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiltman also traced the historical origin of a "universal language", to determine if such an idea had been bounced around early enough. However, this proved difficult, and Tiltman found no concrete examples prior to the mid-17th century. This is two centuries after the Voynich manuscript was written - sometime in the 15th century - and so &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the manuscript was indeed written in a universal language, it would predate these universal languages by two centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiltman noted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was clear that the productions of these two men [Wilkins and Dalgarno, two early proponents of universal languages] were much too systematic, and anything of the kind would have been almost instantly recognisable. My analysis seemed to me to reveal a cumbersome mixture of different kinds of substitution. When I was
  attempting to trace back the idea of universal language, I came upon a printed book entitled The Universal Character by Cave Beck, London 1657 (also printed in French in the same year). Cave Beck was one of the original members of the British Royal Society and his system was certainly a cumbersome mixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beck's writing claims that the idea of a universal language goes back to the 16th century, but this still places it many years after the manuscript's origin.  The idea of synthetic universal languages, though perhaps relatively widespread in the 17th century, simply was unknown in the 15th. This was a strike against Friedman's theory. If the Voynich manuscript was a synthetic universal language, it would have borne no relation - in time of conception of structure - to later examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The universal language route is of course not the only possibility; constructed languages can take many forms. However, it was possible the most promising option, and research into it went nowhere. Friedman's claim remains unsupported, and, to my knowledge, no further academic analyses have been done. We certainly can't rule out the theory that the Voynich manuscript is written in a constructed language, but we have no reason to believe that it is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The oldest language whose creator set out to actually invent a language (as opposed to Pāṇini, who wanted to create a classical standard out of an already  extant language) was probably &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_Ignota" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Lingua Ignota&lt;/a&gt;. The formerly brilliant Langmaker website had &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051110160747/http://www.langmaker.com/db/mdl_linguaignota.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; on it (now accessible through the Wayback Machine). It was made in the twelfth century, predating another early conlang, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaibalan" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Balaibalan&lt;/a&gt;, which was made somewhen between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Khuzdul, Tolkien's mysterious dwarvish language, is limited in vocabulary (we don't know most of the words) and I can't find hello anywhere. Some notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?390991-Thramili-s-Khuzdul-Dictionary(revisited)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, "good" is "gamut" and "day" is "manan", so "gamut manan" might sort of convey what I'm looking for. (On the other hand, I have no idea if the grammar here is correct.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/khuzdul.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; lists neither "gamut" nor "manan" as valid words in Khuzdul, so a reliable dictionary also seems to be somewhat in demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiki.project1999.com/Dwarvish_Dictionary" rel="noreferrer"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; gives "huglgla" as hello. Again, this is listed in neither of the above links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how would you say hello in Khuzdul? Are either of the above three sources reliable? The middle link seems to be closest to Tolkien's actual works, and seems to be cited decently frequently, but perhaps work has been done since that was published.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Well, from what we can glean out of the given texts, I'd be looking for something more like "at your service" rather than "good day".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the movies aren't canon, but Jackson depicts the Dwarves as not really comprehending Bilbo when tries to "good morning" them. And Gandalf's retort is classic. That greeting might be a cultural artifact of the Shire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't place too much faith in the lists you link to. They're fan art, which is fine as far as it goes. Especially the third one: that's just horrible garbled English. I mean really: &lt;em&gt;Baruk Khazâd!&lt;/em&gt; next to &lt;em&gt;Haw aru tauu?&lt;/em&gt; - - - I should think it would be difficult to make a worse reconstruction of Khuzdul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is filled with words with no meaning in English, but which are used consistently, such that the player can at least learn their functions and relationships, if not what they actually mean. The grammar of the text seems to just be normal English, but are there places in the game where it starts to transform its grammar as well?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Recently I encountered the acronym ANADEW, which I found to mean &lt;em&gt;A natlang's already dunnit, except worse&lt;/em&gt;. Pondering a &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/posts/comments/193"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/posts/comments/193"&gt;Logan R. Kearsley&lt;/a&gt; where he speculated that "... it's mildly positive in naturalistic circles, since if a natlang already does it, you know you're justified in using it." I began to wonder what &lt;em&gt;did not&lt;/em&gt; eventually fit in the ANADEW concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gather that &lt;em&gt;Lojban&lt;/em&gt; might be unique in its strong attention to being logical, as explained in two excellent answers to &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/q/90/4"&gt;What makes lojban such a “logical” language?&lt;/a&gt;. If it is not unique, at least it still is something that I don't thing any natlang has as a strong point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short time that this site's been open, it has struck me that conlangs might be &lt;em&gt;improvements&lt;/em&gt; in one way or another over natlangs, yet despite their diversity, they haven't matched the diversity, and utility, of natlangs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what I'm wondering is, other than &lt;em&gt;Lojban&lt;/em&gt; and its "logic" is there some other significant traits that some human conlang has which is not found in a natlang somewhere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't consider using never-before-heard sounds as significant, though that's been mentioned in another question. I &lt;em&gt;would have&lt;/em&gt; considered having a super minimal verb set significant, as in &lt;a href="http://www.terjemar.net/kelen/kelen.php" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Kēlen&lt;/a&gt;, except that, well &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/a/97/4"&gt;ANADEW&lt;/a&gt;, or in this case maybe &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure, I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a conlanger, likely never will be. Nonetheless, I find many fields interesting, and created languages is one of them. With that in mind, please excuse some of my oversights or misconstrued concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are a broad range of answers possible here and it would be impossible to list everything. In general, it is rather easy to come up with a feature that does not seem to occur in natural languages: simply take a feature every language appears to possess (for example: phonemes, verbs, hierarchical syntax that can be described with syntax trees, a very large amount of words) and reject it. Then see what you can do with the language. This leads to so-called &lt;em&gt;Engelangs&lt;/em&gt;, short for “Engineered Languages”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, one can from the ground up decide to build structure from a different “philosophy”, e.g. build on predicate logic, or stacks (the CS concept), or… well, whatever you can think of that can organize information, really. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make an example, there is &lt;a href="http://www.ithkuil.net/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Ithkuil&lt;/a&gt;. Ithkuil does not strive to be a naturalistic language. Instead, its goal is to allow for unambiguity. Among the things it does to provide that are a range of grammatical inflections not found in any natural language - too many to list, but one example I can make is its case system. In most natural languages, case is something of a helper to syntax. Case marks words for their syntactic roles and thus helps create the structure necessary to understand a sentence. In Ithkuil however, case marks &lt;em&gt;semantics&lt;/em&gt;. The sentence “I hit you” in ithkuil would require different cases for “I” and “you” depending on whether e.g. I was a volitional actor, or whether the hitting was an unavoidable circumstance, or an accident, or mediated by someone else… While traces of such systems are found in natural language, none get even close to the extreme of Ithkuil. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, an interesting anecdote is the &lt;em&gt;Conlang Trigger System&lt;/em&gt;, a novel way of structuring languages employed in &lt;em&gt;naturalistic&lt;/em&gt; conlangs (i.e. ones striving to be mistakable for natural languages). The trigger system developed from misunderstandings of the way certain Austronesian languages (such as Tagalog) work. It’s a perfectly plausible system… just not actually attested in natural languages. I believe there’s a nice writeup on the whole topic, but cannot find it right now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There have been many good writeups on &lt;em&gt;Tonogenesis&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. how language acquire tones. But never have I seen such a writeup on the opposite phenomenon, which one might call &lt;em&gt;Tonoexodus&lt;/em&gt;. Obviously, one way for tone to get lost is to simply have tones merge until there’s only one left. However, doing that without any thought to a highly tonal language would be rather disastrous. If any Chinese language suddenly lost all its tones this would likely make communication rather challenging. This makes me think that perhaps, there is more to tonoexodus than just a disappearance of tone. So my question is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any phenomena which go hand in hand with the loss of tone, analogous to how the acquisition of tone goes hand in hand with the loss of consonants or phonations?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Well,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is pretty clear that this is just relexified English, just look at the function words: &lt;em&gt;at, the, of, where, but, is, with, ...&lt;/em&gt;. Also the syntax is 1:1 English syntax, and even the inflections (plural in -s, perfect participle in -ed, third person singular present tense in -s) are the original English one. All in all, it sounds like a strange kind of English slang.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I don't claim to be an expert on this, but I think it may be because that while tonogenesis is a "special" process, in that it produces a whole new dimension to the phonology (as opposed to something more "trivial" like clusters becoming new single segment phonemes), whereas tonoexodus seems to not be much different from other processes of loss in segmental contrasts. Yes, a sudden collapse of the tone system in a Chinese language, or any other language with a high functional load on tonal contrasts would be rather challenging to deal with, but so would any sudden collapse of significant scope, whereas a slow collapse, where contrasts are lost slowly, one after one, in some environments before others gives plenty of time to resolve any disasterous mass ambiguity with innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried looking around for examples of tone loss, and this seems to be the pattern I have been able to find. The Oto-Manguean languages with fewer tonal contrast that the reconstructed protolanguages seem to simply come from mergers of tones, either consistently or only in some environments (e.g. unstressed syllables) though the data is not quite clear&lt;a href="http://www-01.sil.org/acpub/repository/16416.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classical Chinese had 8 tonal categories divisible into &lt;em&gt;yin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;yang&lt;/em&gt; registers occuring respectively after voiced and unvoiced consonants, and into four different categories, &lt;em&gt;ping&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;shang&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;qu&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ru&lt;/em&gt;(checked syllables). While some modern lects such as Songjiang maintain all of these as seperate categories (Songjiang also retains contrastive onset voicing), others collapse the system in various ways. Beijing Mandarin collapses the &lt;em&gt;yin/yang&lt;/em&gt; distinction of the &lt;em&gt;shang&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;qu&lt;/em&gt; tones and merges &lt;em&gt;ru&lt;/em&gt; into the other tones, while the relatively nearby Tianjin Mandarin keeps &lt;em&gt;yin shang&lt;/em&gt; seperate, while merging &lt;em&gt;yang shang&lt;/em&gt; with other tones. Along similar lines the different Chinese lects have radically different distinction-dimininshing sandhi processes, from the well-known relatively limited &lt;code&gt;214 &gt; 35 / _214&lt;/code&gt; rule of Beijing Mandarin to the complete loss of surface realisation of all but one dominant lexical tone in Northern Wu variants such as Shanghainese. Again, there does not seem to be any phonological compensatory measures associated with any of these losses of contrasts.&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=15iz7n8460TEoqAjh9uyld33VadySCUY_" rel="noreferrer"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonoexodus that isn't a simple collapse seems to be hard to find, though the Danish glottal suprasegmental feature &lt;em&gt;stød&lt;/em&gt; likely originates in a pitch accent system (note that some dialects have pitch-accent and some collapse the distinction entirely), and it seems reasonable to expect that other collapses of a two-way tone system to a phonation system could be found. As for other things, the largely autosegmental nature of tone means that it doesn't leave much room for other segmental changes, however there seem to be a few cases of such influences, primarily on consonant voicing discussed in sections 2.6 and 2.7 of Yip's &lt;em&gt;Tone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rxWSzQz-V8sJExiDfc3lW6sl3whCXWnV" rel="noreferrer"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; and references therein, though she notes that it has been argued by Thurgood that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; such alternations are a product of phonation types (which may then coincidentally be associated with tone) influencing voicing rather than tone itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion it seems that the most likely process of tonoexodus is simply a slow gradual loss of contrasts in an increasing number of environments, with the associated lexical replacement/innovation that comes with language change, and a tone system evolving into something else rather than just being lost entirely is likely to become a phonation system, possibly with a minor influence on consonant voicing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Inspired by Leibniz's Characteristica, Transcendental Algebra was created to accompany Edgar de Wahl's international auxiliary &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occidental_language" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Occidental&lt;/a&gt; and allows for the "algebraic manipulation" of facts to calculate truth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like this list wouldn't be complete without a shoutout to &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solresol" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solresol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (not having words seems pretty un-natlang-y to me)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Láadan is a &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/q/33/32"&gt;language created as an experiment in seeing if a constructed language designed specifically for women could better express the views of women&lt;/a&gt; better than natural Western languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained in &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/a/43/31"&gt;@RaceYouAnytime's answer&lt;/a&gt;, in Láadan there are several different words for different types of love, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The language has many affection words&lt;/strong&gt;, for example, of love.[...]&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; love for inanimates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;áayáa&lt;/strong&gt; mysterious love, not yet known to be welcome or unwelcome&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;áazh&lt;/strong&gt; love for someone sexually desired in the past, but not anymore&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ab&lt;/strong&gt; love for one liked but not respected&lt;br&gt;
  [...]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;oham&lt;/strong&gt; love for that which is holy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sham&lt;/strong&gt; love for the child of one’s body&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Excerpt from the above mentioned answer. Parts have been left out ([...])
 for brevity&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How were these words created? Were they created arbitrarily or did they have an inspiration/something they were based on?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;No. "Constructed languages" on this site refers to artificially created languages for intelligent beings, not machine languages. In the absence of another qualifier a "language" is, as I wrote &lt;a href="https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/a/29931/215"&gt;on another site&lt;/a&gt;, a system for communicating &lt;strong&gt;propositional&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;conceptual&lt;/strong&gt; information to other beings. This is different from communication. Programming languages can definitely be used to communicate - and they carry meaning - but that doesn't make them languages. Purely referential communication (using symbols to directly refer to things in the world without metaphorical extension) is not enough to be a language, language &lt;strong&gt;must be able to communicate abstract concepts that are beyond any sensory or referential basis&lt;/strong&gt;. Programming languages are systems for encoding instructions for machines, and not general purpose concept exchange systems.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;For a naturalistic language family one has to apply naturalistic sound shifts and other naturalistic language changes. Those rules and changes are usually directed, therefore it is the best to design the oldest stage of the language (aka the proto-anguage) first and to apply sound shifts and language changes afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing a whole language familiy requires a lot of historical linguistic background, but it is not impossible, as the family of Elvish languages by Tolkien shows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The usual way to approach making a family of related languages is to first make a proto-language (or adopt an existing or reconstructed natural language for this purpose), then simulating natural evolution of both phonology, morphology and semantics in multiple different directions. While the creation of the protolang cannot really be parallellised (though one can deliberately introduce features that one would like to play around with in the following process, or that one can easily see multiple outcomes for), the process of evolving the descendants of the protolanguage can definitely be parallellised, and whether or not to do so is simply a matter of taste (though some things necessarily require some amount of parallel work, such as making a dialect continuum).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are alternative methods to the derivation-from-protolang method, however they tend to either be much more cumbersome (e.g. trying to reconstruct a protolanguage from two or more seperate conlangs) and/or produce results that do not show the same regularity of correspondence that is indicative of genetic relation in natural languages (e.g. trying to just make two seperate but similar conlangs).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;What would a conlang created to be an alternate version of an already existing natural language be classified as?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a version of English that could have been spoken in an alternate steampunk-era Victorian England, or a conlang of the Finnish language in the year 2349. To be clear, I'm assuming that the conlang would be an actual, dedicated one, and not just a few "alternate" words thrown in for flavor; the examples I picked were just the first ones that came to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Bonus: is there a classification for a conlang created to be a conlang of a conlang in this same way?)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Yes, but why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constructed languages would be better for machine communication than natural languages because languages evolve based on how people use them but machines have some difficulties learning how to interpret those changes. With a fully constructed language, the machine can understand exactly what things mean because all of the rules and details are well document and not allowed to change through natural processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, machines already communicate by sending data in specified formats; why would using a constructed language be beneficial in any way?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;While it would technically be "possible" to design a human-modelled language for a computer, it's impractical; machines already communicate using sets of binary symbols, so to speak. Applications on a computer, for example, use an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;application binary interface&lt;/a&gt; (ABI) to relay information and call functions (etc etc) from one another. As there are many different ABIs that may or may not be mutually compatible, you can say that there already are several machine languages in active use, and many more extinct ones (by merit of their machines no longer being in use).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, most constructed languages have no syntactically or semantically ambiguous grammatical constructions. However, would there be any reasons that a constructed language might include certain potentially ambiguous constructions, and if not, why do many (or maybe most) natural languages have so much ambiguity, and why would that not be resolved in natural languages?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If naturalness (being like a natural language) is a design goal, then a conlang can embrace ambiguity with no shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficiency. Most ambiguous sentences are understood well enough in the context they are uttered in, clarified either by prior knowledge, non-linguistic communication (body language, pointing, etc), or through follow up questions from the listener. When most ambiguity is not actually a problem, it doesn't need to be explicitly countered. To require a language to be completely and always unambiguous would require much more specific and cumbersome sentences, violating the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle" rel="noreferrer"&gt;cooperative principle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wordplay. Puns, double entendres, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence" rel="noreferrer"&gt;garden path sentences&lt;/a&gt; are unlikely to be possible or productive without substantial ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;This was one of my example questions but I now am actually interested in the answer.  I am an amateur conlanger; I have one pretty complete language and a couple in the process.  But I can't construct a sentence in any of my languages without referencing the lexicon and grammar.  How common is it for the creator of a conlang to be fluent in that conlang? (especially for languages that are not meant to be spoken like all of Tolkien's, where there is not a very significant fluent community).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I understand why &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; conlangs - they are sometimes needed for world of a book or game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But... why learn them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If most people in the world know normal languages and speak them, we can communicate with them using existing languages. There is no problem with talking with someone without knowing his language, because nowadays a lot of people in the world speak English, which is kind of an international language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn't find a real reason why. We don't talk with characters inside books or movies. We do eventually talk with in-game characters, but they rather speak a normal language, not a conlang. If they don't do so, then we can still understand what they want to say, because games often add some kind of translation, if creators of the game want the player to understand the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is learning constructed languages ever necessary? What are the possible reasons of learning a conlang?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't think this is opinion based. I'm not asking "why do you learn conlangs?" I'm asking for the most common reasons why people learn conlangs, not for opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;An unordered set of potential reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showing off. I know something cool that you don’t. For some, that is the reason to learn Latin but for others that may be the reason to attempt to learn e.g. a language from the Lord of the Rings. It can easily have a vast impression on fans of the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosplay. This is especially true for languages appearing in games/movies/etc. For many cosplayers, the prime goal when cosplaying a character is to mimic them as perfectly as possible. Of course, if you’re mimicking e.g. Eragon after he has learnt the ancient language, you want to at least be able to produce meaningful sentences (unless you’re explicitly aiming for mishaps like the one in the underground city — but arguably that requires even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; knowledge). If you’re cosplaying Arya, that is even more true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a franchise that uses a conlang. If you want to make extensive use of your conlang while writing a series of books like A Song of Ice and Fire, getting it right at later stages is much easier if you have some basic understanding early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because they can. For some people, picking up a language is extremely easy so they may just want to do it for intellectual stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Are there any statistics to show the relative growth and popularity of different constructed languages?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought &lt;a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; could be useful and found &lt;a href="https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/Sitemap.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;some ways&lt;/a&gt; to access raw data there, but that is probably not very representative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: To clarify, I would think growth could be defined as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expanding body of literature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing number of speakers&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence" rel="noreferrer"&gt;garden path sentence&lt;/a&gt; is a sentence whose beginning suggests one parsing which is invalidated as the whole sentence is read and then re-parsed.

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Yes.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loglan is continuously being developed and modified, as &lt;a href="http://www.loglan.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the website shows&lt;/a&gt;. There are new reports about changes to the language (and proposals to do so). The CEO of the Loglan Institute, Randall Holmes, has written periodic reports on the language; &lt;a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/loglan.org/holmes_stuff/fall2015loglanreport.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the one from 2015&lt;/a&gt; shows that several speakers have proposed changes, including the addition of new words (see Appendix 9). For the most part, excluding specific major developments like the Great Morphological Revolution of 1989, &lt;a href="http://www.loglan.org/what-is-loglan.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the structure has stayed the same&lt;/a&gt;, but grammar and vocabulary continue to grow and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the total number of speakers, we have little to no data. My impression is that since the split, Lojban has become more popular than Loglan. The Lojban community is largely Internet-based, and &lt;a href="http://www.lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/lojbanmo.html#AEN536" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;perhaps 20-200 people&lt;/a&gt; use it in some non-negligible capacity. Loglan's userbase is probably smaller than that, although I don't know how small. It's clearly non-zero, but not by much - perhaps 10 or 20 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the question of whether Loglan is dead or alive rests in part on how you define a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;"dead language"&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think anybody has ever learned Loglan or Lojban as a native language; you could therefore argue that it was never alive in the first place. So I suppose the best answer to your questions is that yes, Loglan is still being used and changed, but it's not "alive" in the sense of most languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Loglan Institute &lt;a href="http://www.loglan.org/what-is-loglan.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;considers Loglan to be alive&lt;/a&gt; because of the constant grammar/vocabulary changes; they define a dead language as one that isn't evolving. Based on that definition, Loglan is indeed alive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Jan's answer covers most of the reasons to learn conlangs.  I just want to add more on why people create them, which should illuminate why people learn them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You say you understand that people create conlangs for the "world of a book or game."  This is the case, but there are many other types of conlangs. Conlangs can be created as a linguistic experiment, an attempt for people to speak more logically, as a language intended to become universally accepted (arguably the most famous conlang, Esperanto, is for this purpose).  They can be created to add spice or realism to a world, like Dothraki, Klingon, Quenya; they can be just for fun, or a secret language to speak with your friends.  You can even make a language for only women, so they can communicate on an equal footing with men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then why do people learn conlangs?  Well, it depends what type it is.  Maybe you just want to because you can--or maybe you genuinely believe that it is the only logical way to communicate.  Or maybe you're a huge fan of Star Trek and you want to speak klingon.  Or maybe you just want to be able to communicate with your siblings without your parents understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about conlangs is that you don't need to care about them unless you're interested.  They don't affect your lives unless you want them to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Lojban's &lt;a href="http://www.lojban.org/publications/formal-grammars/grammar.300.txt" rel="noreferrer"&gt;official formal grammar&lt;/a&gt; is written in YACC, which is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser" rel="noreferrer"&gt;LALR(1) parser&lt;/a&gt; generator. Since this means that the parser only ever "looks ahead" a maximum distance of one token while parsing, garden path sentences are impossible in the traditional sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This just means that the parse tree can't be drastically transformed during the sentence—it doesn't mean that the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of sentences can't be changed signficantly later on within them. The first example that comes to mind is the song &lt;em&gt;NA KU&lt;/em&gt; from Djemynai's &lt;a href="https://djemynai.bandcamp.com/album/zao" rel="noreferrer"&gt;ZA'O&lt;/a&gt;, which contains the chorus "&lt;em&gt;pu ku zvati fa do .ije ca ku zvati fa do... na ku&lt;/em&gt;." This glosses roughly as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pu-ku zvati   fa-do
PST   present 2sg.NOM
You were here.

.i-je ca-ku zvati   fa-do   na-ku
and   PRES  present 2sg.NOM NEG
Now you are not here.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the use of &lt;em&gt;ku&lt;/em&gt; allows the negation particle to be moved to the very end of the sentence. This does not affect the parse, so it's not a traditional garden path sentence, but it still allows the creation of a surprising effect, which is similar in some senses.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;For example, can it be shown that there are more auxiliary than artistic conlangs? Note that I'm not talking about use, but about which type is more popular to create. The answer can address any level of specificity; i.e. it could address types, subtypes, very broad generalizations, etc. (I'm afraid I don't know very specific categorizations to be more clear; feel free to edit or suggest better words in the comments.) I would prefer answers focused on conlangs from more "modern" times; say, starting with the introduction of Tolkien's languages forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no answer is possible because the data doesn't exist or isn't organized in a way that allows for such an inventory to be taken, that is also acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;This is a hard to answer question, as there isn’t any statistically useful database. &lt;a href="http://cals.conlang.org/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;CALS&lt;/a&gt; has a bunch of data, but only a small subset of conlangers have ever entered their data there. There, there seems to be a clear preference for the creation of &lt;strong&gt;Artlangs&lt;/strong&gt;, i.e. creating languages simply for the sake of creating art, not to fulfill any purpose. &lt;strong&gt;A priori&lt;/strong&gt; langs seem to be favoured over &lt;strong&gt;a posteriori&lt;/strong&gt;, likely because the latter is quite a bit more work-intensive (every new vocabulary item needs to be researched if one wants to do a good job at it…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A larger sample size can be found on &lt;a href="http://reddit.com/r/conlangs" rel="noreferrer"&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are no statistics there, and the sample is skewed in favour of beginner conlangers (only few experienced conlangers ever frequent it. source: personal experience as a moderator). To get an idea of the data, we can use Google search results.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artlangs&lt;/strong&gt;: 430 (this number is problematic because this category appears to be taken as the default by many, yielding no search results)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, on reddit, taking inspiration from existing European language families is very common. From personal experience, among more experienced conlangers there are very few people trying to create auxiliary languages, most people striving to either create naturalistic languages or to push the boundaries of linguistics in some way or another. But I cannot provide any data for this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;This is a hard to answer question, as there isn’t any statistically useful database. &lt;a href="http://cals.conlang.org/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;CALS&lt;/a&gt; has a bunch of data, but only a small subset of conlangers have ever entered their data there. There, there seems to be a clear preference for the creation of &lt;strong&gt;Artlangs&lt;/strong&gt;, i.e. creating languages simply for the sake of creating art, not to fulfill any purpose. &lt;strong&gt;A priori&lt;/strong&gt; langs seem to be favoured over &lt;strong&gt;a posteriori&lt;/strong&gt;, likely because the latter is quite a bit more work-intensive (every new vocabulary item needs to be researched if one wants to do a good job at it…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A larger sample size can be found on &lt;a href="http://reddit.com/r/conlangs" rel="noreferrer"&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;From personal experience (active member in a large server of avid conlangers) &lt;em&gt;very few&lt;/em&gt; people ever learn to speak their own conlangs. Language learning is a very time-intensive progress and there is not much gained from learning a language no one else speaks. The occasional exception tends to be found in group projects, in which sometimes at least to a part “creating by using” is used as a technique, which naturally leads to at least rudimentary command of the language. Some languages have also been developed exclusively by using them, such as &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/3y2yek/viossa_an_experimental_pidgin_one_year_in_the/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Viossa&lt;/a&gt;, but this is an exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also be interested in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/QbHkh_2RJjA?t=14m5s" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt; at LCC6, held by Jim Hopkins &lt;em&gt;in his conlang&lt;/em&gt; (with an interpreter, of course).  Summary of the talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this presentation Jim Hopkins, creator of Itlani, will share his tips and techniques for recording, learning, and living the Language of your Soul. He will discuss the need for finding and ensuring stability in your language’s vocabulary and structure to facilitate easier learning, and how to immerse yourself in your language for mental and emotional engagement, even though you aren’t living full time among native speakers. The presentation will be done entirely in the Itlani language, with interpretation into English by Tony Harris.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;My experiences are largely the same as those of Adarain, though I have access to a data-set that perhaps better shows the predominance of artlangs, as I moderate a moderately sized discord server in which users can request roles that show what kind of languages they make and at the same time get a fancy-coloured name. Many users have more than one roles and the roles are not mutually exclusive either. The first number is the amount of people who have the role, the second number is the amount of people who have it as their primary colour:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A posteriori: 24, 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A priori: 73, 19&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artistic: 66, 43&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auxiliary: 11, 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineered: 16, 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joke: 8, 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secret (for secret communication): 12, 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers clearly show the dominance of a priori artistic languages. Additionally, all but one of the people with auxiliary as their main colour are relative beginners, though this a rather small sample and it may come down to server culture as much as anything.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It's probably a lot more common for a person to be fluent in his own conlang when dealing with auxiliary languages. Esperanto, Ido, Interlingua, etc. all have large communities of speakers (relative to most conlangs), and I assume their creators also spoke them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is likely because the languages were designed for communication, and because the vocabulary is usually designed to be easily recognizable to as many people as possible, which makes learning it easier than learning an &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; vocabulary and grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of a relatively recent auxlang is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_Franca_Nova" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Lingua Franca Nova&lt;/a&gt;, created in 1998, which already has a lot of speakers. By contrast, a systematic "engelang" (engineered language) like &lt;a href="http://ithkuil.net/index.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Ithkuil&lt;/a&gt; would be extremely hard for anyone to master, and its creator is &lt;a href="http://www.ithkuil.net/faqs.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;not fluent&lt;/a&gt; in it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Everything in this answer is taken from the website of the Láadan language (&lt;a href="https://laadanlanguage.wordpress.com/laadan-reference/notes-on-adding/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;link to the page&lt;/a&gt;).  I am by no means an expert, but this is directly from the mouth of Laáadan's creator.  The following quote contains pertinent excerpts of the article, parts of which I have put in bold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Another goal I had for Láadan was that &lt;strong&gt;it should be as easy as possible to figure out what a particular word or morpheme means just by looking at it&lt;/strong&gt;...I wanted the language to work like a Tinkertoy® set works, so that people could take the pieces and fit them together easily to make larger forms. For example: the Láadan word for “bee” is “zhomid”; that word is made from “zho” — the Láadan word for “sound,” and “mid” — the Láadan word for “creature.” &lt;strong&gt;The meaning is transparent from the word’s parts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, however, I had to construct the most basic elements of the language — the words/ morphemes that are called “roots” and can’t be taken apart into smaller meaningful pieces&lt;/strong&gt;. When linguists begin working with a language for which no grammar or dictionary is available, they ordinarily start with a set of roughly 100 very basic words made up of items like “eat” and “sleep” and “food.” I followed that practice, and began by constructing a core vocabulary of those basic words; when I had those done I began adding additional roots that I felt were needed. &lt;strong&gt;Sometimes I can explain to some extent how I chose a particular shape for one of those words; much of the time I can’t.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;For example… I can explain that I chose “oódóo” for “bridge” because when pronounced its tune makes the shape of a humpback bridge. I can explain that I chose “rul” for “cat” because the purring of a cat sounds to me like “rulrulrulrul…” But the choice of “ana” for “food” and “ina” for “sleep” was arbitrary; &lt;strong&gt;I have no explanation for those choices other than that I tried to give them a shape that could easily be combined with other morphemes.&lt;/strong&gt; For any constructed language that isn’t based on some existing language, the hardest part will always be putting together the inventory of roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="http://www.sfwa.org/members/elgin/LaadanLessons/LaadanVocab0306.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;update to the Láadan dictionary&lt;/a&gt; shows that not all of the words were created by Suzette Haden Elgin (the creator of Láadan) but all that are not roots in and of themselves--roots which seem to have been created rather arbitrarily--can be figured out from these roots.  For example, in the dictionary I linked, the word for beaver is "eduthemid."  This contains the rood for animal, "mid," and some other root, I presume "eduth."  I do't know what this means, but it was constructed in this way so that someone who knew these roots but did not know the word could discern that it means beaver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original creator of Láadan made a couple of arbitrary roots that could then become a lexicon through a logical process of morphology, with help from multiple other people.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm an amateur conlanger, but I've seen multiple instances of people using the Lord's Prayer as a test or a way of showing off a translation of their conlang.  I've even done it a couple times myself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this such a common practice among conlangers?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The above answers didn't rely resonate with me. I will try to explain why i started to learn a constructed language called lojban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Better Meaning extraction for human-computer interaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to build AI's and talk to them like real humans. The problem i'm facing is how to convert my English &lt;strong&gt;from speech&lt;/strong&gt; to - &lt;strong&gt;text form&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;then into meaning&lt;/strong&gt; - so that the computer can take different programmatic actions depending on that meaning.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And i want to do this with complex thoughts - not "Cortana close the light" type of commands. That is easy to do it in English already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;English and most other languages is not well suited for easy parsing of meaning. The amount of ambiguity in any non trivial phrase is enormous. Exponential complexity is a big problem. We humans solve it by putting things into context - and also trough lot's and lot's of experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even so  - we sometimes misunderstand each other.. Keep in mind that we are very smart. Computers are kind of dumb at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building this context and this experience in an AI is almost an inapproachable task. Building the context is even a bigger problem then parsing the relations between words. It's called an AI hard problem. Only big companies like Google and Microsoft have the resources to approach a problem of this size. Cortana is mostly pre-scripted answers at this point (feb 2018). Is not the real deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you have a constructed language like lojban - you have at least 2 big benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the speech to text conversion happens very easily - because lojban has no phonetic ambiguity. Words are typed the way they are pronounced. Is a 1 to 1 mapping. I don't need to understand what you meant in order to know for certain what you said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the grammar is very congruent / precise - and is said to have zero exceptions - this makes parsing and meaning extraction easier by orders of magnitude. Ambiguity is still an issue - but a manageable one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In English - we extract meaning and solve ambiguity by relying mostly on statistics. We garter billions of phrases - and based on that we &lt;strong&gt;infer&lt;/strong&gt; what is &lt;strong&gt;the most probable meaning of a phrase&lt;/strong&gt;. We do this with models based on neural networks - that are black boxes for the most part. Point is - grammar rules are not that useful in English. When you debug your program - you can't clearly see why a certain chunk of text was summarized to a certain phrase. You can use your human intuition - and you can agree or disagree with the summary - but if you disagree - you can't easily inspect the decision that the computer took at each step. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntF5cFZq1PA" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Introduction to the parsing problem is a good place to start.&lt;/a&gt; The production systems are more advanced then this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In lojban, by contrast things are simpler: there are only verbs(selbri) and nouns(sumti) - actually is more like - &lt;strong&gt;functions&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;arguments to those functions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can heavily rely on rules - and that is enough to get the meaning out with a very high accuracy. And in principle is scalable  .. phrases, paragraphs, pages .. hole speeches, hole books, the entire Wikipedia - a web of meaning.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is why i'm interested in it. A web of meaning - as opposed to a web of data. Right now computers can see &lt;strong&gt;the data&lt;/strong&gt; - but they can't see &lt;strong&gt;the meaning&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Answer to questions the way an Expert would do it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another even more interesting use-case for a constructed language is it's ability to provide a sufficient and universal representation of knowledge that is easy to query by computers. We are interested in getting useful answers from big amounts of unstructured data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is trying to do this for ages. You still get bad results even for easy to answer questions. The way an expert answers a question - is different from google. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need more of that expert answer. This is almost always true for complex questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You want the answer alone&lt;/strong&gt; not 10's of articles that might or might not contain the answer - articles that you need to read yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this situation is primarily because 99.9% of human knowledge is represented as text - mostly in English - which is very hard to parse, and query in a meaningful way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one way to solve this - is to have all this knowledge in a system that is easy to query by design. And this is what constructed languages can potentially offer. And i don't mean sql databases - is way better - is in the computation itself. The way we humans do it internally - the computers will be able to do it as well. We are still a far cry form that - but i think this direction is promising..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. On a personal level. Language might affect the way you think.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is best express by watching an awesome movie like Arrival. or by reading articles &lt;a href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/does-language-i-speak-influence-way-i-think" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If lojban were to be our default language instead of English - i think our entire civilization we would have been centuries more advanced that we are now - not just technologically - but in general. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm just learning this stuff myself. But hopefully this allows you to see that there are much more practical applications - with very serious consequences then just: "you look more smart in front of your friends" - that is not something would convince me to get trough the struggle of learning a new language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there are people that don't struggle that much - for them the other reasons might make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there are people that don't struggle that much - for them the other reasons might make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It is a long standing tradition to use the Lord's prayer as a sample text for illustrating natural languages, for instance, the mid-16th century &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmographia_%28Sebastian_M%C3%BCnster%29" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Cosmographia by Sebastian Münster&lt;/a&gt; contains the &lt;a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmographia" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Lord's prayer in Finnish&lt;/a&gt; as an illustration of the Finnish language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has the advantage of being available in many languages, including otherwise ill-documented or dead languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its disadvantages are the religious bias and the fact, that some very marked constructions tend to occur in this text (in German, there is a relative clause in the second person singular &lt;em&gt;..., der Du bist im Himmel, ...&lt;/em&gt; a really rare beast).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In addition, inventories should be remotely gridlike. That is, if a series of phonemes of one manner of articulation occurs (let's say /p t k q/), then a similar series is likely to occur at another (e. g. /ɸ s x χ/ is more likely to occur than /θ ʒ h/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language#Phonology" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is an example of what not to make. The article shoehorns the inventory into a grid, but you should notice that there are a lot of gaps. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya#Consonants" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a somewhat more realistic inventory.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Is it more appropriate to start by creating nouns, verbs, general sentence structure words ie "the, a, or", or from somewhere else, when creating a language from scratch? Would it be more proper to start constructing the rules? Note that this is in general cases, when one isn't creating a language which explicitly rules out usage of any speech element.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It depends very much on the purpose of your language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generic advice is: &lt;strong&gt;Create the words and sentences you need&lt;/strong&gt; for your purpose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want to draw a map of a fictional world, create a system for naming geographical features. When you want to name fictional people, create a system of given names. When you want to have some dialogues, mottoes, or set phrases: Create just them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are aiming at an international auxilliary language, create a system of derivational morphology first, then fill in stems and roots and function words. At some time, you will go through some dictionary and think of a word or expression for every dictionary entry. The risk of doing it too early is ending with a relex of the starting language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, the comment by @The Mattbat999 also has good advice: before creating words, think of the sounds of your language (phonology) and of allowed combinations of the sounds (phonotactics).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're new to conlanging and want to start an entire language from scratch:&lt;/strong&gt;  I would recommend reading The Language Construction Kit by Mark Rosenfelder.  It's a fun read and is very helpful to a new conlanger, and helps you know what to create for your purposes, how to do this, and gives you a good understanding of basic linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For creating vocabularies from scratch:&lt;/strong&gt;  A common practice is to begin with a list of roots and expand outwards, usually using some kind of derivational morphology.  The words you're going to want to begin with, besides words that come up in your grammar, which I think should be close to done by the time you start building a lexicon, are the basic concepts.  Things like man, tree, water, eat, do, green.  One famous example of such a list is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Swadesh list&lt;/a&gt;.  The way I made my vocab for my first language, Simean, was by coming up with roots for the concepts on this list and using morphological rules to expand that list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another alternative, though one I don't personally use, is to simply translate things and make up the necessary words as you go along.  Even so, I'd start with the Swadesh list to get a good grounding in terms of what your language feels, looks, and sounds like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Apart from the historical usage that &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/a/212/48"&gt;jknappen&lt;/a&gt; brings up, the &lt;em&gt;Pater Noster&lt;/em&gt; is simply a short, relatively straightforward, universally well known text. Probably the other most common text is the Tower of Babel story. Again, short &amp; straightforward. Perfect texts for the glossopoet whose language is not yet all that robust either lexically or grammatically.  This one also touches kind of near to the heart of all glossopoets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't see any particular religious bias in either text, so that's a ymmv (and anyway, not a good road to go down, please). As for that 2s relative clause in the German translation, of course, the same kind of rarity is in the English text. Good exercise for the nascent invented language! And good exercise for the glossopoet, having to think about and sort out curiosities of grammar right from the start!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;You should think of phonology  in terms of &lt;strong&gt;distinction&lt;/strong&gt;. You have to distinguish certain consonants and vowels from others, and you have to figure out the best way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A realistic inventory has spread out places of articulation, often symmetrical. It's much easier to make a distinction between spread-out consonants that between consonants that are articulated similarly. That's why this is a really common inventory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;             Front Central Back
Close        i             u
Near-Close
Mid-Close    
Mid          e             o
Mid-Open
Near-Open
Mid-Open           a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is unheard of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;             Front Central Back
Close        i             u
Near-Close   ɪ             ʊ
Mid-Close          ɘ
Mid                   
Mid-Open
Near-Open
Mid-Open    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should always make sure a language makes distinctions that are spread apart, e.g. /p t k/, rather than distinguishing three types of t-sounds /t̼ t ʈ/ without also having a distinction from /p k/ (unless for some reason you're making a language to be spoken by aliens without lips, for instance). There's also no reason to have only three consonants /p d kʰ/; you should either have only one set (such as /p t k/), or have a set for each of them (i.e. /p pʰ b, t tʰ d, k kʰ g/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every rule has its exceptions, but this is true of most natural languages, and you should use this as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Some more details can be found in my answer on &lt;a href="https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/26868/1270"&gt;Linguistics&lt;/a&gt;, from which I copied some of the examples)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One of my works-in-progress is a language called Proto-Oreadin.  As the name suggests, it is a proto-language, which eventually I am hoping to expand into a family of languages.  Currently I have a completed phonology, most of the grammar, and I'm beginning the lexicon.  My plan to create these daughter languages is by using the &lt;a href="http://www.zompist.com/sca2.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;zompist.com sound change applier app&lt;/a&gt; to evolve the words of my language into multiple daughter languages, and then apply semantic shifts, borrowings, and other pieces of worldbuilding context—but that's a separate issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I have no idea how to even begin choosing rules for sound changes, nor how to describe them.  I've looked at examples of natural languages, but I'm not sure what's going on with the notation, nor have I been able to identify any patterns that will help me create realistic sound changes for my languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are sound changes notated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the general categories of sound changes?&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I guess this forum really isn't set up for the kind of intense assistance &amp; interaction you really need. Conlang-L or Reddit or CBB would be forums better suited, but I do have some ideas that might serve to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it seems like you've got a handle on the basics and are really asking for a directional nudge, I'd suggest the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make a short list (maybe a dozen) of Proto-Language words and sort them by various characteristics: words that begin with a voiceless stop; words that contain a voiced stop followed by a syllabic liquid; words with an accented long vowel root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pronounce one of the words over and over and try "permutations in the phonetic neighbourhood" like CWAD&lt;strong&gt;RUT&lt;/strong&gt; CWAD&lt;strong&gt;RUT&lt;/strong&gt; CHWAD&lt;strong&gt;RUT&lt;/strong&gt; CHWADHRUT &lt;strong&gt;CHWAAH&lt;/strong&gt;RUTH &lt;strong&gt;HWAAR&lt;/strong&gt;RUS HWAARUH &lt;strong&gt;HA&lt;/strong&gt;WARƏH &lt;strong&gt;HAW&lt;/strong&gt;WAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make a note of how certain sounds are "eroded" or, I guess more properly, how they &lt;em&gt;evolve&lt;/em&gt;. [kw] relaxes into [hw]; [dr] &gt; [ðr] &gt; [r]; as the final syllable weakens, the accent shifts towards the word head; as the accent shifts towards the word head, medial long vowels become shortened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sit back in astoundment how you've just discovered several sound change rules!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't like that progression, try another one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind of a simplistic exercise, but it's a good method to start. Eventually, other rules you discover are going to intersect and sometimes abrogate another law. Sometimes two parallel dialects run along slightly different tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes dialects are "behind the times" when compared to others, and this will launch you into the wonder world of diachronics. The study of when sound changes occur in a particular place and in what order the changes happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, you're considering a whole family tree, so you're going to need to do this exercise multiple times. You might find that two or three daughter lineages kind of align in certain ways. For example, *cwadrut yields hawar in language A and qewarro in language B and kawrs in language C but shwuntz in language D and shhwandaras in language E.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you examine other words, you notice that ancestral [k-] remains [k] or becomes [h] (both palatal sounds) in several languages, all of which are at the eastern end of this proto language's continuum; while most of the languages where ancestral [k-] has become [ʃ] are all in the west. A nice geographic split (that may or may not actually mean much), much like that which exists within Indo-European languages.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;To answer part a), the basic syntax of the notation goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;] &gt; [&lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt;] / [&lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The part after the slash gives the situations in which the sound changes occur. For example, the hypothetical spirantization of [b] to [v] intervocalically could be notated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b &gt; v / V__V&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule indicates that b becomes v when surrounded by a vowel (V) on each side. The __ indicates a "placeholder" for where the original sound was and where the new sound goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other common notations are # for word boundaries and [+feature] or [-feature] to indicate the presence or lack of a certain feature respectively. For example, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final-obstruent_devoicing" rel="noreferrer"&gt;final-obstruent devoicing&lt;/a&gt; in e.g. Russian could be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[+stop][+voiced] &gt; [-voiced] / __#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where the __# means that the stop in question (__) is at the end of a word (#).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for b), the best way to get an idea for what kinds of things generally happen in languages is honestly probably just by reading about lots of different languages and seeing what tends to happen. Some of the most common general processes are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenition" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, probably one of the most common sound changes, in which a "softer" sound becomes a "louder" sound. (There are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonority_hierarchy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;some general rules&lt;/a&gt; that determine what this actually means, although it can vary between languages). A few examples are intervocalic flapping in many English dialects (/bɛtər/ → [bɛɾɚ]) and the pronunciation of /b, d, g/ as fricatives or approximants, roughly [β, ð, ɣ], in most contexts in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assimilation_(phonology)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assimilation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is another frequent sound change. This occurs when features of a given phoneme are influenced by the phonemes around it. For example, in English and Spanish, /n/ becomes [m] before bilabials and [ŋ] before velars (e.g. &lt;rainbow&gt; [ɹ̠ʷej&lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt;bow], &lt;concordar&gt; [ko&lt;strong&gt;ŋ&lt;/strong&gt;koɾðaɾ]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar ideas are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut_(linguistics)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;umlaut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_harmony" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vowel harmony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which vowels change depending on other vowels in the word. Remnants of Germanic umlaut can be seen in English, e.g. foot/feet, and vowel harmony is prominent in e.g. Turkish, where all of the vowels in a word have to harmonize (for the most part) so that affixes have several different forms (for example, the genitive suffix is [in] after front unrounded vowels, [ɯn] after back unrounded vowels, [yn] after front rounded vowels, and [un] after back rounded vowels).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are general patterns, it's also important to note that some sound changes seem completely illogical and random, and just... sort of happen. The most infamous examples are the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruki_sound_law" rel="noreferrer"&gt;ruki rule&lt;/a&gt;, where [s] became [ʃ] but only after [r, w, k, j] (?), and strangest of all, Proto-Indo-European *dw to Armenian erk (???). So you really have a lot of room for creativity here, while still being able to be naturalistic. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Most languages contrast demonstrative in a "here/there/over there" distance system, with &lt;a href="http://wals.info/chapter/41" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;two to five grades&lt;/a&gt; (with some referring to the hearer's location too). I'm looking for a different concept for demonstrative contrast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have suggestions for me?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Boustrophedon writing systems are ones in which the direction of writing swaps after each line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Boustrophedon.png" alt="Example from Wikipedia"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithkuil" rel="noreferrer"&gt;least one conlang&lt;/a&gt; is intended to be written as a boustrophedon (in that case vertically.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you manually typeset a document your could reverse the lines, but that doesn't allow for plain text boustrophedon writing, nor does it allow for reflowable text (such as on a webpage.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any ways of encoding text in Unicode to mark it as boustrophedon? There are multiple &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-directional_text#Table_of_possible_BiDi-types" rel="noreferrer"&gt;text direction control codes in Unicode&lt;/a&gt;, can any of them be used for boustrophedon text? Or has anyone proposed a control code to be included in Unicode, or designated one in a Private Use Area?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or are there any other practical ways of publishing boustrophedon text (because a custom PUA code wouldn't be supported by most software) such as some kind of CSS filter for a webpage?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Since conlangs by their very nature don't start out with any speakers, and in most cases the author is not immediately a skilled user of the language, conlangs tend start out dead, and so under this definition almost any conlang with a speaker community would technically once have been dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, going by "dying" as having a community, then losing it, reliable data is somewhat hard to find, as a small remainder of a community (which could be as little as two individuals' private postal correspondence) can be very hard to locate especially in pre-internet days, though it seems that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom_Neutral" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Idiom Neutral&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published in 1902, once had largely fallen out of use, but has recieved a recent revival by enthusiasts in a couple of internet usergroups and blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, going by "dying" as having a community, then losing it, reliable data is somewhat hard to find, as a small remainder of a community (which could be as little as two individuals' private postal correspondence) can be very hard to locate especially in pre-internet days, though it seems that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom_Neutral" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Idiom Neutral&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published in 1902, once had largely fallen out of use, but has recieved a recent revival by enthusiasts in a couple of internet usergroups and blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Are there any ways of encoding text in Unicode to mark it as boustrophedon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the unicode.org FAQ about bi-directional text&lt;a href="https://unicode.org/faq/bidi.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Unicode Standard does not provide formatting codes to signal boustrophedon text. Specialized word processors for ancient scripts might offer support for this. In the absence of that, fixed texts can be written in boustrophedon by using hard line breaks and directionality overrides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know of any online method of inputting reflowable boustrophedon text, however there seems to be a LaTeX package&lt;a href="https://github.com/lowfatcomputing/latex-boustrophedon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; availible that offers automation of the process at least in LaTeX documents, both for "regular" boustrophedon and the Rongorongo style where glyphs are rotated rather than mirrored, which would allow for relative ease of publishing pdf documents at leat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As the linked WALS chapter already mentions, a common distinction is to contrast near speaker/near listener/distal rather than a simple distance constrast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to make such as system more "interesting" can be to add additional usages or shades of meaning to the different demonstratives, for example having one be a neutral term and the other one that is only used when specific focus on the distance is desired, or alternatively having a neutral demonstrative in addition to ones overtly marked for distance (the WALS chapter again already has examples of this, mentioning modern Hebrew and Lithuanian respectively). Korafe (TNG, Oro Province PNG) has a 3 demonstratives &lt;em&gt;e, a, o&lt;/em&gt; in a speaker/listener/distal system which additionally serve the function of showing emontional evolvement of the speaker in utterance, with &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; "near listener" being the neutral default, &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; "near speaker" showing a great deal of involvement and &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; "distal" showing a desire of the speaker to distance and dissociate him/herself from the utterance&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2hgQLVtMsqZeXVBMUpWX3Q4ckE" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1 pp.75-77&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variables may be paradigmatically overlaid on top of a distance system, e.g. a visibility contrast as seen in Malagasy(Astronesian, Madagascar)&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malagasy_language#Deixis" rel="noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, or may supplement it, for example by having a 3-way proximal/distal/non-visible contrast. Other contrasts than visibility are possible, for example in Fore(TNG, Eastern Higlands Province PNG), which has a 5-way speaker/listener/proximal/medial/distal system, with proximal and distal further exhibiting a 3-way same level/above/below vertical relationship, for a total of 9 different demonstratives&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2hgQLVtMsqZeXVBMUpWX3Q4ckE" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than overlaying various such contrasts on a system there is also the possibility of instead having a large set of what may be called "positional stems", whith relatively specific semantics such as "up above", "on the beach" or "towards the Siberian mainland" which can then either be used as or derived into demonstratives. The various Yup'ik languages(Eskaleut, Bering Sea area) are an example of languages with a lot of these, and using various specialised and general nominal morphology allows forming demonstrative pronouns and adverbs with meanings such as "the ones up there" or "from the two entities upstairs/on the mountain", though I think there is a fair bit of variation in the actual meaning of the different stems between the different lects and langs. Section III.4 of &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lB-Izi_GRc15obQHG3fUni-_T6ZHifqJ" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this document&lt;/a&gt; covers them summarily as they are used in Gambell, St. Lawrence Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A somewhat similar in result but structureally different approach to this is exemplified by Nasioi(South Bougainville, Bougainville Province PNG), which rather than have a large inventory of deictic stems and a limited set of affixes instead has just one demonstrative stem &lt;em&gt;a~e&lt;/em&gt; from which a large number of directional, as well as some nominalising and oblique affixes may derive different demonstratives such as &lt;em&gt;a-un-toom-peto&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;DEM-NOM-down.north-near.movement_toward&lt;/code&gt;"that down there, closer, ascending towards us from the north" or &lt;em&gt;e-eʔ-dan-to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;DEM-INSTR-seaward-far&lt;/code&gt; "by going seaward far away (from us)"&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2hgQLVtMsqZeXVBMUpWX3Q4ckE" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;My answer is a little biased, but I can speak for the history of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solresol" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Solresol&lt;/a&gt;. Solresol was invented in the early 1800s, grew in popularity over the next ~70 years, even after the death of its creator, and then (apparently) abruptly died out in the early 1900s, despite supposedly being at the peak of its popularity. There were only a few brief mentions of Solresol throughout the 1900s in books about universal language attempts. Then, in the 1990s, someone started a mailing list discussion about Solresol through reading one of those books, and the community has been slowly growing ever since, with a desire to further develop and promote the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/a/235/139"&gt;Gufferdk makes a good point that it's difficult to prove the "death" of a conlang.&lt;/a&gt; There is no known documentation of Solresol being in use through most of the 1900s, but I cannot prove that more private communication did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One example of this would be the massively more complex &lt;a href="http://www.ithkuil.net/faqs.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Ithkuil&lt;/a&gt;, whose author says this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for a hypothetical community of Ithkuil-speakers, I do not think Ithkuil would serve the purpose of being the primary day-to-day language, as I agree the language would quickly degenerate into a “vulgar” form due to its complexity. &lt;strong&gt;I see Ithkuil’s hypothetical usage as being a specialized language for specific purposes where exactitude and clarity of cognitive intention is called for, and to make deliberate obfuscation difficult, e.g., political debate, the teaching and discussion of scientific disciplines, the discussion of philosophy, the written presentation and preservation of history.&lt;/strong&gt; As such, it would be a “learned” language (like learning a computer programming language or the predicate calculus) whose structure would be consciously preserved by its speakers. An analogy might be the way that Classical Latin continued to be used for over a milennium after the death of its last native spearker for academic and religious purposes. A similar analogy is the use of Modern Standard Arabic (essentially a modernized version of Classical Arabic) in official and academic contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;emphasis mine&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the nature of the question, it's highly inconcievable that we could answer it exhaustively.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Christians are quite firm in their beliefs and as such many pray the Our Father (Pater Noster) with great devotion. I would be very surprised if a Christian liturgical celebration did not recite the Our Father at their Sunday services. I know many who recite this prayer before meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the popularity of this prayer, I am not surprised that it is so commonly used as a translation tool. Even some private schools will pray the Our Father before class and that in turn will be said in the language of the class being taught: Pater Noster for Latin class and the Notre Pere for class in French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to see if some Christian high school would recite the Lord's Prayer in Elvish in a Constructed Language course if one exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://liturgy.co.nz/lords-prayer-elvish" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Quenya&lt;/a&gt; translation is by J.R.R. Tolkien (published in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvish_Linguistic_Fellowship#Vinyar_Tengwar" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Vinyar Tengwar&lt;/a&gt; #43).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Átaremma i ëa han ëa,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;mal áme etelehta ulcullo.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Násie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one can see the Our father is short enough to be memorized over a very short period of time and this prayer has immense value for a certain percentage of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all due respect let us remember that the Lord's Prayer was taught by Jesus Christ himself. For those who believe that is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I can imagine a system that is based on size/importance instead of one based on near me/near you/distant. In this system, one demonstrative would point to the larger, more massive, more important, less recently introduced etc., another would point to the smaller, less massive, less important, more recently introduced target. Various degrees of intermediates could be thought of between these two extremes (but I think just one intermediate would be the most obvious choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More practical examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people talking about cars on a road. In a this/that system, one might say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I like that huge car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while pointing at one. In the system I’m imagining, that would turn into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I like [Demonstrative-important] car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;without the need to point a finger. It would immediately imply the largest car to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A discussion about which colour a dress should be. A blue one was introduced first, a red one second and now we are looking at a green one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I like [Demonstrative-intermediate] best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we may be looking at the green one and without turning any heads it would be clear that red is preferred. My train of thoughts here is that the first introduced object has been sitting around for a while in the discussion and thus acquired some sort of importance of the elder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can even easily be applied to people. Depending on what the culture of your conlang values, I can imagine both mere height or age/respect factoring into the decision which one of two people would get the important demonstrative. In Japan, if the choice is between the young, tiny professor and the older, larger secretary, the professor would probably be labelled with [demonstrative-important]. But going by age or size alone may make more sense in other cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interesting feature when applying it to people is that the demonstrative would change depending on who is a potential target. Comparing a teacher to their students would mean they receive [demonstrative-important]. However, if the headmaster is part of the group being talked about, the same teacher would suddenly be [demonstrative-intermediate] or [demonstrative-unimportant].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, many more examples are possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Let's take an element of Lojban's grammar, and see if it's semantically ambiguous.&lt;br&gt;
In lojban, &lt;em&gt;tanru&lt;/em&gt; are basically two predicates in adposition. The first one semantically modifies the second one; and that's all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{&lt;code&gt;lo zdani gerku cu barda&lt;/code&gt;}: The house dog is big.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{&lt;code&gt;lo gerku zdani cu barda&lt;/code&gt;}: The kennel is big.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where {&lt;code&gt;zdani&lt;/code&gt;} (roughly) means "home", {&lt;code&gt;gerku&lt;/code&gt;} means "dog", and {&lt;code&gt;barda&lt;/code&gt;} means "big (the rest is grammatical witchcraft, don't bother).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first example, {&lt;code&gt;zdani gerku&lt;/code&gt;} is syntactically a &lt;em&gt;tanru&lt;/em&gt;, and {&lt;code&gt;zdani&lt;/code&gt;} modifies {&lt;code&gt;gerku&lt;/code&gt;}. However, the &lt;em&gt;tanru&lt;/em&gt; is primarily about {&lt;code&gt;gerku&lt;/code&gt;}.&lt;br&gt;
In the second one, it's the reverse. {&lt;code&gt;gerku zdani&lt;/code&gt;} is also syntactically a &lt;em&gt;tanru&lt;/em&gt;, but {&lt;code&gt;gerku&lt;/code&gt;} modifies {&lt;code&gt;zdani&lt;/code&gt;}; and the overall tanru is about {&lt;code&gt;zadni&lt;/code&gt;}, not {&lt;code&gt;gerku&lt;/code&gt;}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it isn't possible to make assumptions about the overall meaning of a tanru. Though it's syntactically not ambiguous, it is semantically ambiguous.&lt;br&gt;
I've chosen the english “house dog” and “kennel”, but it was just my intent, and english translates this way. Officially, it's not possible to infer the meaning from a tanru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even read yourself in the &lt;a href="https://lojban.github.io/cll/5/2/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;last official reference grammar&lt;/a&gt; that “All tanru are ambiguous semantically.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a surer version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{&lt;code&gt;lo gerku poi ta'e zvati lo zdani cu barda&lt;/code&gt;}: The dog that uses to live at the house is big&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{&lt;code&gt;lo zdani poi zukte ke'a lo nu stuzi lo gerku cu barda&lt;/code&gt;}: The house that is aimed so that dogs could live in is big.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I don't think that languages, whether natural or constructed, have this power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that there are numerous ways to be deceptive. You can straight out lie, you can speak as if there is uncertainty when really there is not, you can be deceptive through what you don't say, and you can be deceptive by saying true facts that are not actually strictly relevant, something called &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171114-the-disturbing-art-of-lying-by-telling-the-truth" rel="noreferrer"&gt;"paltering"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most linguists now, I think that the weak Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, that our language influences our thoughts and decisions, is surely true, but I am sceptical about the strong version, that language completely determines and limits our thought categories. Either way, I don't think it's really relevant to the aspect of human psychology which makes deception possible. Lying through omission or distraction is possible because our minds can generate multiple possible statements to make to others, each disclosing a different level of truth, but none of us are compelled to speak every thought that enters our minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps someone has invented an alien species with an alien psychology and an alien language to speak, and maybe in their universe their language does compel them to speak honestly. But what would it mean to prove such a thing, and how could anyone else present an argument to refute their claims? So for humans I say the answer is no, and for fictional creatures it's not a useful question for us to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;What are the primary way(s) accusative case markers can develop? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary way of development of oblique case markers seems relatively straightforward, with attachment of adpositions (which can already be considered "case markers" under some definitions and which can in turn come from nouns or verbs) on the noun, then possible generalisation onto all elements of the NP as agreement. Ergative cases are a little less straightforward, but they very frequently have an oblique double function, hinting at origins such as reinterpretation of passive constructions or the generalisation of usage of e.g. instrumental or ablative case markers as markers of unexpected agency (e.g. via the occasional omission of agents in sentences like "[the man] opened the door &lt;strong&gt;with&lt;/strong&gt; the key").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of accusative cases seem less straightforward to me though, and while reinterpretations of antipassives are a readily availible source that doesn't to me seem like a plausible origin for the majority of accusative markers, nor does it provide a way to go from no case marking to accusative (which seems like a thing that should be able to happen), and I'm not aware of any similar broad tendency of oblique double-function as seen in ergatives which could otherwise hint at origins. As such I particularly would like to know what oblique cases could reasonably be extended to accusative, and under what circumstances the original extension (from which further generalisation could be done) may occur under, and additionally if there are any reasons accusatives seem to have fewer double functions (even if this is just a result of me looking in the wrong places).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;This is merely a marginal answer and I’m sure there’s a lot more data that might prove valuable, but in multiple Romance languages (at least Spanish and Romansh) the preposition &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; has developed into an accusative marker for particularly animate objects. This preposition derives from Latin &lt;em&gt;ad&lt;/em&gt; “to(wards)” and is in both languages somewhat equivalent to English &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; in usage (in Romansh it is commonly used to mark the dative as well, as in French).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general I would not be surprised to see allative or dative adpositions turn into accusative markers, there is quite a bit of overlap in the meanings (compare “I hit towards you” and “I hit you”).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One of the unique challenges of a constructed language, in my mind, is how they handle the way in which language longs to break rules.  In other words, how does constructed language handle &lt;strong&gt;slang&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the entire notion of underground language runs entirely contrary to the notion of &lt;em&gt;constructed&lt;/em&gt; language, where the rules are strictly prescribed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in unique cases where conlangs have had time to brew with native speakers, such as with Esperanto, have we seen specific examples of slang develop within the language?  What conditions seem to prompt the development of slang terms in such circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Are there any tools out there to keep track of which works you have already defined, managing your lexicon easily, and storing conjugations and the like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barring that, what are some good strategies to keep everything organized in text files?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://draquet.github.io/PolyGlot/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Polyglot&lt;/a&gt; is a piece of software made specifically for the organisation, and management of conlangs as a whole. I haven't used it personally (preferring pen and paper to a large extent), but I've heard a fair few positive things about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://conworkshop.info/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Conworkshop&lt;/a&gt; includes a bunch of different tools for storing and organising things, but I've personally not found it particularly useful, and I have heard from people who have looked at the backend that you &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; want to look at the backend, though I think they are doing a rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;SIL Fieldworks&lt;/a&gt; is a vocabulary management program, and while developed for natlang lexicographers, it's also useful for conlangs. It's a rather powerful tool, but it has a significant learning curve to it. SIL also publishes other potentially useful free software such as &lt;em&gt;Toolbox&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://software.sil.org/products/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;https://software.sil.org/products/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lexiquepro.com/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Lexique Pro&lt;/a&gt; is a piece of software for making and editing presentable dictionaries. I haven't used it but it apparently offers compatibility with Fieldworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these, a regular spreadsheet program and a text editor can be quite useful, and there is a sea of both web and downloadable word generators (e.g. &lt;a href="http://zompist.com/gen.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Gen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://akana.conlang.org/tools/awkwords/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Awkwords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://acta-lingweenie.tumblr.com/post/115081554505/lexifer-my-word-generation-tool" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Lexifer&lt;/a&gt;) and sound change appliers (e.g. &lt;a href="http://zompist.com/sca2.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;SCA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://akana.conlang.org/tools/gsca0.8/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;GSCA&lt;/a&gt;), and for writing publishable materials, LaTeX, combined with a variety of packages for extra functionality such as Lingmacros and TikZ can produce fantastic results.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Wiktionary has a list of &lt;a href="https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Esperanto_internet_slang" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Esperanto internet slang&lt;/a&gt; but most of these I've never seen or heard used before (at least in the main esperanto chats on Telegram).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esperanto slang terms I've heard or used&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;krokodili - to speak in a language other than esperanto in a group of esperantists. No one really knows where it originated but the most popular story seems to be that it's because crocodiles have big mouths and small brains. "Ne krokodilu" is a very commonly used phrase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sal - hi (short for saluton)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kvf - how are you (abbreviation of kiel vi fartas)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mdr - lol (multe da ridoj)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mns - idk (mi ne scias)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interjections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ho ve (occasionally just "ve") - oh geez&lt;br&gt;
(according to &lt;a href="https://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/1956/how-do-you-translate-oh-woe-is-me"&gt;this post on Esperanto SE&lt;/a&gt; the literal translation is "oh woe" but who says that)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8, ok, okej - k, ok, okay&lt;br&gt;
("ok" is the word for eight in Esperanto, mdr.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ho - oh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jes ja - yes, indeed&lt;br&gt;
(according to &lt;a href="https://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/1052/how-is-ja-used"&gt;this post on Esperanto SE&lt;/a&gt; "ja" can be used in other situations, but I have never heard or seen it used other than after "jes")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fek' - f*ck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kio la fek - what the f*ck&lt;br&gt;
(This is an obvious anglicism and considered "grammatically incorrect" by many esperantists, who will tell you it's actually &lt;a href="https://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/904/what-are-the-grammatically-correct-alternatives-of-kio-la-fek"&gt;kio feke&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volap*ko - "the v word". More offensive than all the offensive words you know combined.&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In Esperanto, the word &lt;em&gt;knuflo&lt;/em&gt; is mainly used by &lt;strong&gt;young&lt;/strong&gt; people, who participate in local &lt;strong&gt;meetings&lt;/strong&gt;, around the &lt;strong&gt;dutch-speaking regions&lt;/strong&gt; of Flanders and the Netherlands. It is almost not used in international context, like on the Internet ("knuflo" esperanto gives less than 12 results with Google), outside of groups that are community specific. Outside of these groups, the word is not understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knuflo is like hugging, but longer, with more parts of the body. It is like cuddling, but it is hard to describe. Users say you have to receive a &lt;em&gt;knuflo&lt;/em&gt; to understand it, and you have to experience it to understand why the word is needed in the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here, you have three factors. People sharing the same factor tend to speak together. When people speak mainly within their own community, slang appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt; factor: Young people coin new words for the &lt;strong&gt;new environment&lt;/strong&gt;, and for &lt;strong&gt;concepts that are felt important for the social group&lt;/strong&gt;. It is exactly the same in Esperanto. But there is no clear barrier. Here is a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GwHvknlfV-k?t=4m15s" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;footage of an older person using the word "knuflo"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt; factor: Not all Esperanto-speakers participate regularly in Esperanto events, in fact only a minority do. There is an &lt;strong&gt;event-slang&lt;/strong&gt;, with words such as "gufujo", "stelo (mono)", etc. Esperanto events are often attended by people from neighboring countries. This way local slang is shared among people of different countries and age. Because of this, you can sometimes hear "knuflo" in French-speaking Belgium and Germany (near the Netherlands). The word is also shared in huge international youth events like JES and IJK, where a consequent number of participants come from the knuflo-region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language&lt;/strong&gt; factor: "knuflo" comes directly from the Dutch verb "knuffelen". Dutch-speaking beginners who are not aware of similar words like "brakumo" "kareso" "dorlotado" are more likely to remember and understand "knuflo". This kind of &lt;strong&gt;beginner-slang&lt;/strong&gt; tend to not go outside the local club, but "knuflo" is an odd exception. Maybe because some local experienced speakers think it brings new meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;All languages, natural or constructed, must have verbal negation. So, in any language, it must be possible to say something and to negate that same thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sidney is in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Sidney is not in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since only one of these can be true, it follows that any language makes possible to say at least as many falseties as truths (in practice, many more, as we can lie that Sidney is in Russia, Gabon, or the Middle Earth). And so, no. A language cannot compel its speakers into honesty.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Programming languages are constructed, but they are not languages, in the sense English or Esperanto or Klingon are languages, &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/a/164/112"&gt;as curiousdannii shows&lt;/a&gt;. We cannot translate things like "I will be late for dinner" into a programming "language". And a characteristic of all "languages", properly speaking, is their mutual "translatability".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As a programmer and a conlanger, I'd say "no". As noted above, programming languages cannot convey metaphor, emotions, sensory impressions, and other such human-relevant messages. Abstraction they can handle, but only abstractions that are relevant to the processing going on inside the machine. Such languages have an extremely limited sphere of reference: bits, bytes, and data structures inside the machine, and operations upon them. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;What I'm thinking is: if two conlangs have the same syntactical structure and can be translated by simply exchanging words while maintaining the same (or very similar) structure, is there are specific term for this scenario, and are there any examples for this? I'd imagine Lojban and Loglan would probably fit in this category as Lojban is, after all, a child project of Loglan. Are there any other examples of conlangs designed with identical (or very similar) syntactic features, and is there a name for this relationship?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I would say, to a very limited extent, that yes, they can be, but only as a proxy grammar for other languages. For example, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;from sys import exit as stops ; import os
thing = [] ; me = can = remember = False ; this = open(__file__)
def terrible(v): return v

# ==== start song snippet

me = can = remember = not any(thing)
can = not this.tell(), [True, "dream"]
locals()["deep"] = {"down":{"inside":{"feel_to":"scream"}}}
if `this` + (terrible("silence")): stops(me)

# ===== end song snippet
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this isn't a great method of communication. Programming languages are not designed with the same intentions as conlangs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The phonology table shows it quite simply, it modifies the &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; to indicate that it is a long vowel. I don't know why the vowel table shows the dipthongs &lt;code&gt;a:i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a:u&lt;/code&gt; but not &lt;code&gt;e:i&lt;/code&gt; (or any others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that although this may seem to be a common colon, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_(phonetics)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the actual IPA diacritic&lt;/a&gt; is two triangles, flat sides on the outside: U+02D0 &lt;code&gt;ː&lt;/code&gt;. But as the colon doesn't have another meaning in the IPA and it's much easier to type, a lot of people just use it instead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Yes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not familiar with any “well-known” conlangs, but a quick search reveals that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_grammar#Verbs" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Klingon&lt;/a&gt; verbs inflect for both subject and object. This is a phenomenon called &lt;em&gt;polypersonal agreement&lt;/em&gt; and it is &lt;a href="http://wals.info/chapter/102" rel="noreferrer"&gt;very common in natural languages&lt;/a&gt;, and so it is only expected that it would also crop up in several conlangs. Among them, for example also my own, for which I just yesterday put up a puzzle that involves decoding the verbal system &lt;a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/60412/deer-hunting-in-mesak"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot currently think of any examples of a language which inflects for &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; the object, but it’s a rather low-hanging fruit and I cannot imagine that it has never been done before.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It’s well-known that among inexperienced conlangers¹, many times their conlangs turn out to be way more European than intended, often showing features found only rarely outside of European languages, because the creator is not aware there was even an option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m curious now is whether among the “big names” such as Klingon, Na’vi, Dothraki etc. there are any such accidental Europeanisms? We can disregard Tolkien’s works as he was actively taking inspiration from various European languages (such as Welsh or Finnish²). Obviously auxlangs meant to suit primarily Europe can also be excluded, and whatever Esperanto is meant to be I’m well aware of the situation there, so you can exclude that from answers as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¹ Who are native speakers of an European language, i.e. statistically probably English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;² While not Indo-European, Finnish does share many features with other European languages.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%27vi_language" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Na’vi language&lt;/a&gt; for the movie &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was created from scratch by a linguistics PhD, Paul Frommer. In an interview available on &lt;a href="http://usoproject.blogspot.jp/2009/11/interview-with-paul-frommer-alien.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Unidentified Sound Object&lt;/a&gt;, he details how the language was devised. The director, James Cameron, had created about 30 words many of which he needed as place names. These helped Frommer understand what kind of sounds Cameron had in mind. They discussed what the language would need to be and sound like in general and then Frommer was on his own. Most notably, the only input from the director was a set of isolated words and confirmation that the primary way to differentiate between them should be stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frommer decided that he wanted to employ all sorts of features of various human languages in a unique combination. Thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;verbs are inflected by infixes, not the more common prefix or suffix models (suffix inflection is a feature of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Average_European" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Standard Average European&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the case system is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartite_language" rel="noreferrer"&gt;tripartite&lt;/a&gt;, a feature which exists but is rarely found in natural languages; SAE would be nominative–accusative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the language features &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejective_consonant" rel="noreferrer"&gt;ejective consonantes&lt;/a&gt;. Again, these are found in about 20 % of the world’s languages but only the Caucasian languages feature them in Europe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it seems like any features present in Na’vi that are also present in European languages would be a conscious design choice to not make it too non-European.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the &lt;a href="http://usoproject.blogspot.jp/2009/11/interview-with-paul-frommer-alien.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; also briefly mentions Klingon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;USO: Is there a “gold standard” for constructed language that served as an inspiration to you?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Frommer: In terms of “alien” languages, that would have to be Klingon, the language developed by linguist Marc Okrand for the &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek&lt;/strong&gt; series. It’s a very impressive piece of work—a rough-sounding language with a complex and difficult phonology and grammar that now has a devoted base of followers. There are Klingon clubs all over the world where people meet to speak the language, and there’s even a translation of Hamlet into Klingon! If Na’vi ever came close to that kind of following, I’d be delighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hints that Klingon, which was also developed by a linguist, would similarly be free from eurocentric bias.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cals.conlang.org/feature/102/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;CALS&lt;/a&gt; lists 9 conlangs where the verb only agrees with P in transitives, 20 where it can agree with either A or P, and a further 127 where the verb agrees with both A and P, though of the ones listed, the only really well-known one is Klingon, which Adarian also mentioned. Including Mark Rosenfelder's langs (which aren't in CALS) in the at least relatively well-known bucket, &lt;a href="http://zompist.com/wedei.html#Verbs" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wede:i&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://zompist.com/lenani.htm#ergabs" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Old Skourene&lt;/a&gt; both inflect the verb for both A and P to different extents (though note that Old Skourene works on an ergative basis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the languages that mark P but not A, most of them are listed as having ergative agreement and so presumably agree with S as well, however two of them, &lt;a href="http://cals.conlang.org/language/yemls/feature/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;'Yemels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cals.conlang.org/language/snahhian/feature/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Snahhian&lt;/a&gt; are listed as accusative, and so presumably has the verb agree only with P.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, despite conlangers often liking to solve problems by throwing affixes at them, a complete lack of personal agreement is actually overrepresented in CALS, &lt;a href="http://sasha.sector-alpha.net/~ptsnoop/calswals2a/102_verbal_person_marking.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;when compared to WALS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The short answer is, no, the language from Arrival is not a full conlang. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logographs were designed by artists and designers, and while some components of the logograms were assigned meaning, they did not design enough of it or its rules for it to be possible to make new symbols with definite meanings. They did hire linguist Jessica Coon to consult on the film, and she annotated printouts of the logograms so that the set designers would know what to put in the background and on the whiteboards (if I remember correctly, they consulted physicists for similar work as well). They also had Stephen and Christopher Wolfram provide some analysis and design the computer program used to analyze and generate them in the film. But in the end, the movie was not for linguists or conlangers, so they did not design it as a fully-fledged conlang -- and given that it's supposed to be a mystery that they don't quite solve in the film, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;While it's true that languages like Na'vi and Klingon (can't speak for Dothraki) do contain quite a few explicitly non-&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Average_European" rel="noreferrer"&gt;SAE (Standard Average European)&lt;/a&gt; features, it's worth noting that both Paul Frommer and Marc Okrand have stated that they were deliberately using less common and lesser-known features in their respective conlangs to make them sound more alien. Since avoiding features that would be considered common or familiar to their audiences (typically comprised of speakers of English and other SAE languages) was a goal during their language creation. I'd argue that deliberately avoiding all SAE features to make your language sound "strange" and "alien" is a sort of eurocentrism (though perhaps a less obvious sort than unthinkingly including all SAE features) in that your language ends up very influenced by European languages and their features.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;When I've seen a clear distinction made here, it has been the following: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isolating languages have a very low morpheme-per-word ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytic languages have little inflection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this distinction is not made very consistently, so they're often used interchangeably. I have also seen a different distinction made, where analytic languages have a low morpheme-per-word ratio and isolating languages have a morpheme-per-word ratio of 1:1, though this one is less common in my experience. The fact that even with this distinction isolating languages end up being a proper subset of analytic languages only makes this problem worse. This has its origins in the definition of "synthetic", the category both of these are typically contrasted with, since it's used both as a description of languages with a high morpheme-per-word ratio and as a description of the superset of terms like fusional and agglutinative, both of which describe languages with lots of inflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, conlangers seem to make too big of a deal out of these sorts of labels. They're there to be descriptive, so it's not a problem to discard them when they aren't, and they're often far less informative than most who use them think.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;To gauge how well these languages have achieved their goals, we really need to quantify what exactly achieving those goals would entail, and what steps along that path we would consider progress. What constitutes success for Toki Pona or Loglan? A world of people thinking differently? A small group of speakers who have improved the way they think substantially based on learning the language? Without knowing that, we cannot say whether these languages have achieved their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when looking for research into linguistic relativity, the place to look would be linguistic research, and we're unlikely to see much research into Toki Pona's or Loglan's influence on the minds of their speakers. Why? Well, strong Sapir-Whorf is pretty much a settled question in linguistics -- the vast majority of the field agrees it's not the case -- and weak Sapir-Whorf is more likely to be tested on natlangs for many reasons, not least of which is the number of potential subjects. Even the most popular conlangs have much smaller speaker communities compared to most natlangs, and so even if conlangs and natlangs were equal in all other ways when it came to this research (and from a linguist's perspective, they really aren't), it would be far harder to gather subjects and conduct research for the conlangs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I had a look through the conlangs in Wikipedia and listed which ones I could see morphologically marked TAME categories. There are sure to be some mistakes in here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tense: Atlantean, Dothraki, Esperanto, Glosa, Idiom Neutral, Interlingua, Kalaba-X, Kēlen, Kotava, Láadan, Langue nouvelle, Lingwa de planeta, Loglan, Mondial, Na'vi, Neo, Novial, Quenya, Sambahsa, Sindarin, Solresol, Sona, Syldavian, Universalglot, Uropi, Valyrian, Verdurian, Volapük, Wenedyk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aspect: Kēlen, Esperanto (participles only), Ithkuil, Klingon, Na'vi, Quenya, Wenedyk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modality: Atlantean, Esperanto, Ithkuil, Kēlen?, Langue nouvelle, Solresol, Sona, Syldavian, Uropi, Valyrian, Wenedyk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidentiality: Láadan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's the verdict? Not only does this show that the conlang community has a strong Eurocentric bias, I think it shows it has a massive &lt;strong&gt;Anglocentric&lt;/strong&gt; bias! Because it is English which is so strongly tense prominent. Most other current European languages also mark aspect or modality, but English doesn't even have a full aspect inflectional system, just the continuous &lt;em&gt;-ing&lt;/em&gt;. Some European languages arguably don't even have tense, such as Koine Greek (for the last decade this has been a huge debate among Biblical scholars.) And evidentiality, which is present all around the world, including some European languages (some Slavic) was only present from what I could see in a single conlang! &lt;strong&gt;If Anglocentric bias were not a factor I would expect to see conlangs with a much broader distribution of inflected TAME categories, but as it is, 80+% have tense&lt;/strong&gt;, maybe alongside aspect or modality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, many languages had muddled/fusional verb paradigms. You've probably seen them before: they include tense, aspect, the perfect, mood, utterance type (question or command), all in one table, each affix marking some combination of these semantic categories, but the combinations aren't very visible when they're listed one-dimensionally. Where are the agglutinative conlangs? Don't forget that European languages includes Turkish and several Uralic languages! (I found one conlang which is agglutinative in its verbal morphology: &lt;a href="http://conlang.wikia.com/wiki/Einodo#Verbs" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Einodo&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, often even when I judged a language to have aspect or modality it was because they had something called a "conditional" or a "subjunctive", rather than a core division between the prototypical categories: realis/irrealis, or perfective/imperfective. Now maybe some of those languages do actually have what should be analysed as the simple core categories, but they have been given alternate names by those describing them in Wikipedia. This reflects the Eurocentric and Anglocentric bias which is a big problem in descriptive linguistics. A helpful and short book about the importance of being aware of your biases in relation to TAM categories is &lt;a href="https://benjamins.com/#catalog/books/slcs.49" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Prominence of Tense, Aspect and Mood&lt;/em&gt; by D.N.S. Bhat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;This is pretty common in natural languages. Think about English words -- most of them have an inherent part of speech and require derivational affixes to change that. "Anger" is inherently a noun and requires "-y" to become an adjective, whereas "excite" is inherently a verb and requires "-ment" to become a noun or "-ed" or "-ing" to become an adjective. This sort of thing is incredibly normal in natlangs -- the reason it seems a bit abnormal in Esperanto is that Esperanto derivation is far more productive than even derivation-heavy natlangs, leading to irregularities in these sorts of changes being much more noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as an aside, because "human-" is inherently adjectival, you would not say "humano" to mean "humane-ness", but "humaneco" (&lt;a href="http://vortaro.net/#humana" rel="noreferrer" title="Plena Ilustrita Vortaro de Esperanto: Humana"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). Adding the "-eco" suffix, meaning "the quality of" or something to that effect, is necessary for adjectival Esperanto roots. This is the very reason &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Esperanto roots are said to have inherent part of speech, and it's a large part of why the "-eco" suffix exists in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been interested in learning Solresol, as the idea of it intrigues me. But I haven't been able to find anything in English to learn it from (the original works on the language are in French, which I don't know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked out &lt;a href="https://www.sidosi.org/resources" rel="noreferrer"&gt;sidosi.org&lt;/a&gt;, and it shows a couple of links to an English translation of the original grammar of Solresol, but &lt;a href="http://mozai.com/writing/not_mine/solresol/sorsoeng.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;one redirects back to the sidosi.org homepage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://webspace.utexas.edu/bighamds/LIN312/Files/SolReSol.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;one leads to a message saying the site has been retired from service&lt;/a&gt;. Other resources are also linked, and also turn out to be missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So are there any resources (preferably online) to learn Solresol from English?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Length&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things. First, Lojban often needs longer sentences to express something than it does in, for example, English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Vocabulary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Lojban's vocabulary isn't that big, especially in the domain of sciences. Words would have to be calqued, adapted from English, French, etc. or completely re-invented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Loaning and naming&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the English language (and many natural languages) loans words directly (for example, &lt;em&gt;champagne&lt;/em&gt; could be *shampain and &lt;em&gt;buoy&lt;/em&gt; could be *boy or *boi) without changing spelling (a slight counterexample would be German, which often changes the letter c pronounced [k] to the letter k, like &lt;em&gt;Kanada&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vokabular&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lojban doesn't. &lt;em&gt;.Romas.&lt;/em&gt; is Rome (Italy), &lt;em&gt;.xavanas.&lt;/em&gt; is Havanas (Cuba) and &lt;em&gt;.lidz.&lt;/em&gt; is Leeds (UK). This makes it confusing in some cases. How would Lojban adapt &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turra_Coo" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Turra Coo&lt;/a&gt; or people like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela&lt;/a&gt;? The name should stay recognisable but pronounceable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rhetoric&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, many rhetorical devices such as these would be boring, simply boring. Shakespeare would be an ordinary novel writer, the Bible no longer so majestic and this sentence boring. Language would be unambiguous: literature boring. Language needs rhetoric, rhetoric needs language. Epizeuxis. Epizeuxis. Epizeuxis. Alliteration acts amazingly when all aposiopesis achieves is... Aposiopesis achieves... Aposiopesis... Rhetoric is not unlike magic. What would we have without rhetoric? We'd have a boring and a world. Rhetoric, her voice is beautiful, her heart full of peace and her prosopopoeia angel-like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, to finish that rant, try to translate this to Lojban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A shocking affair occurred last night. Sir Edward Hopeless, as a guest at Lady Panmore’s ball, complained of feeling ill, took a highball, his hat, his coat, his departure, no notice of his friends, a taxi, a pistol from his pocket, and finally his life. Nice chap. Regrets and all that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I believe your question conflates two related, but crucially distinct concepts, patients (a thematic relation and semantic concept) and objects (a verbal argument and syntactic concept).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By conventional syntactic definition, if only one argument is being agreed with, that argument is the subject. In that sense, it's &lt;strong&gt;by definition impossible&lt;/strong&gt; for a verb to agree only with an object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;the patient of a verb does not have to be its object!&lt;/strong&gt; In ergative languages, it's generally acceptable to analyze that the syntactic subject of a transitive verb is its patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary: it makes no sense to say that a verb agrees only with its object, because it would causes that object, by definition, to be the subject, merely reversing the agency alignment of the verb (cf. English &lt;em&gt;I like X&lt;/em&gt; vs. Spanish &lt;em&gt;me gusta X&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person has a higher animacy valency, so requires a (slightly) more polite idiom.&lt;/p&gt;

To this end, he created Esperanto, a language that would be easy for most people to learn, due to it's logical, regular design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking from experience, one of the difficult parts of learning a new language is keeping different meanings straight for words that have different meaning. It's a little hard to bear at times how many words mean many things.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One of Lojban's most famous features is, of course, its lack of syntactic ambiguity. While this is an advantage in some cases, it can also be a limitation. It wouldn't likely be an issue in something like Wikipedia, but does make certain kinds of wordplay impossible. Take for example this exchange from Lewis Carroll's &lt;a href="http://www.alice-in-wonderland.net/resources/chapters-script/through-the-looking-glass/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Through the Looking Glass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;'Who did you pass on the road?' the King went on, holding out his hand
  to the Messenger for some more hay.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;'Nobody,' said the Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;'Quite right,' said the King: 'this young lady saw him too. So of
  course Nobody walks slower than you.'&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;'I do my best,' the Messenger said in a sulky tone. 'I'm sure nobody
  walks much faster than I do!'&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;'He can't do that,' said the King, 'or else he'd have been here first.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Lojban there is no way to conflate "nobody" meaning "no person" with "Nobody" meaning "someone named Nobody", because proper names are always preceded with the article "la". Other works that rely on wordplay based in syntactic ambiguity would also present major difficulties in translating to Lojban. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;a href="http://alis.lojban.org/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Lojban translation of &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so these difficulties aren't necessarily insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;the physical unit "Watt" was first borrowed as ŭato, to distinguish it from vato ('cotton-wool'), and this is the only form found in dictionaries in 1930. However, initial ⟨ŭ⟩ violates Esperanto phonotactics, and by 1970 there was an alternative spelling, vatto. This was also unsatisfactory, however, because of the geminate ⟨t⟩, and by 2000 the effort had been given up, with ⟨vato⟩ now the advised spelling for both "Watt" and "cotton-wool".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One also has to bear in mind polysemy: a word that might correspond to one concept in English might translate to two different words in Spanish or German. A classic example is “corner”, which can be translated to Spanish as either &lt;em&gt;rincón&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;esquina&lt;/em&gt;, depending on whether one is talking about an “inside” or “outside” corner. I went to check how Esperanto deals with that particular word and found that eo &lt;em&gt;angulo&lt;/em&gt; refers not only to both kinds of corners, &lt;a href="https://en.bab.la/dictionary/esperanto-english/angulo" rel="noreferrer"&gt;but additionally also means “angle”&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, Esperanto clearly has polysemies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In addition to the examples cited above, it's worth noting that due to Esperanto's extensive use of derivation and encouragement to use affixes as productively as possible, there is the potential for semantic ambiguity to arise. This occurs when a string that is an affix also occurs within a root word. For example, the suffix &lt;em&gt;-em&lt;/em&gt; means "a tendency/propensity for...", deriving words like &lt;em&gt;kompatema&lt;/em&gt; "charitable" and &lt;em&gt;kompatemo&lt;/em&gt; "charity/mercifulness" from &lt;em&gt;kompato&lt;/em&gt; "compasson, pity". However, what of a word like &lt;em&gt;modemo&lt;/em&gt;? The root &lt;em&gt;mod-&lt;/em&gt; means "fashion", so upon encountering this word you might assume it means "tendency to be fashionable" or something like that, but it's also a root of its own meaning "modem". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, realistically, this would be distinguishable from context, but then again that's the case for "watt" vs. "cotton wool" too. These sorts of weird ambiguities based on affixes are pretty rare anyway, and I don't think there's anything wrong with Esperanto having a few, but they aren't nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it's worth noting that when it came to "logical, regular design", Zamenhof was mostly concerned with avoiding irregularities in inflection and derivation. I'd argue he didn't &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; succeed, but he definitely cared more about that than he did polysemy.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, the suffix &lt;em&gt;-em&lt;/em&gt; means "a tendency/propensity for...", deriving words like &lt;em&gt;kompatema&lt;/em&gt; "charitable" and &lt;em&gt;kompatemo&lt;/em&gt; "charity/mercifulness" from &lt;em&gt;kompato&lt;/em&gt; "compasson, pity". However, what of a word like &lt;em&gt;modemo&lt;/em&gt;? The root &lt;em&gt;mod-&lt;/em&gt; means "fashion", so upon encountering this word you might assume it means "tendency to be fashionable" or something like that, but it's also a root of its own meaning "modem". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, realistically, this would be distinguishable from context, but then again that's the case for "watt" vs. "cotton wool" too. These sorts of weird ambiguities based on affixes are pretty rare anyway, and I don't think there's anything wrong with Esperanto having a few, but they aren't nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it's worth noting that when it came to "logical, regular design", Zamenhof was mostly concerned with avoiding irregularities in inflection and derivation. I'd argue he didn't &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; succeed, but he definitely cared more about that than he did polysemy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://xcom.com/news/entries/en-creating-the-advent-language-in-xcom-2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; the dev team of XCOM 2 explain that they didn't have the time or resources to invent a full conlang, but instead made up gibberish that got across the sort of 'feeling' they wanted. In order to sound "darker and more ominous," they were deliberate in their choice of sounds for this gibberish, basing it on so-called "guttural languages" such as German and Dutch, and then they designed filters to make the voice actors sound more robotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Steve helped shape the final sound by experimenting with the gibberish pronunciations that we came up with. In order to convey meaning to the player, we had to rely solely on the tone and delivery of the lines, with things like ‘Halt!’ Or ‘Enemy Spotted!’ coming across with more intensity than say a standard ‘I’m moving’ line. In the process I also tried to establish vocal patterns in each subset of lines to create some cohesion between the otherwise meaningless words the actors were reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A feat on the part of the sound designers and voice actors, to be sure, but not a proper conlang. Nothing stopping XCOM fans from expanding it into a full conlang, though!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Many of the world's natural languages, and some conlangs, have a free word order, so that the words can be put in any order with it still making sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they can't use word order to indicate the structure, what strategies do they use instead? Have any conlangs used strategies not found in natlangs?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The way these languages do this is with inflections.  Nouns, for example, can be declined to show cases, which tell the speaker things about what they are doing.  Verbs can be used to show who the subject is, and the tense and mood and stuff.  For example, in English we would say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The boy loves the girl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in Latin (I don't know any other languages with cases well enough for this answer) we would say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Puer puellam amat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of info here: the first word (&lt;strong&gt;puer&lt;/strong&gt;), meaning "boy" is in the nominative case, meaning it is the subject of the sentence.  &lt;strong&gt;Puellam,&lt;/strong&gt; girl, is in the accusative, meaning it is the direct object.  In addition, the verb, &lt;strong&gt;amat,&lt;/strong&gt; has the 3rd person singular present indicative ending &lt;strong&gt;-t.&lt;/strong&gt;  In this case this isn't enough to tell us who the subject is, as both the nouns are 3rd person singular, but coupled with the nominative, we can easily figure out who is loving whom.  Therefore, the same thing can be expressed as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Puellam amat puer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amat puer puellam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or any other combination you'd like, and the listeners or readers would understand because of the cases of the nouns.  Latin has six or seven cases (depending), but some languages have more.  Finnish has 15, Hungarian has 18; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has a whole bunch of cases that appear, all to free up the word order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of these, many prepositions can be omitted entirely, verbs can use inflections to show the subject and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjectives that modify nouns must agree in case with the nouns--so a reader can easily infer their meaning from what case they are in.  Because of these, word order having any grammatical function is unnecessary and redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As another example, my own conlang Simean has four cases.  Here is a sentence with all of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nuler loyile shuir edeï sefmou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translated, this is: "The soldier (Nominative) is giving the king (Dative) of the land (Genitive) a book (Accusative)."  The verb, &lt;strong&gt;loyile,&lt;/strong&gt; is the stem &lt;strong&gt;loy-&lt;/strong&gt; plus the imperfect affix &lt;strong&gt;-i-&lt;/strong&gt; plus the third person singular &lt;strong&gt;-le.&lt;/strong&gt;  If instead, we wanted to say "I am giving the king of the land a book," we could take out sefmou, soldier, and we wouldn't have to add in the word for I because of the verb inflection.  Instead, the subject could be expressed through the verb.  Instead of the &lt;strong&gt;-le&lt;/strong&gt; we would use &lt;strong&gt;-ë,&lt;/strong&gt; and the listeners would know what we were talking about--who gave whom what and all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, any one of these words could be moved somewhere else--the only thing in Simean that dictates word order is convention.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Apart from the morphological / grammatical angle, we can also understand meaning by context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A mournful song sang the choir.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except in the &lt;em&gt;Land of Strange Tales&lt;/em&gt;, we know that choirs sing songs. Songs don't sing choirs. The inversion is startling when interjected into speech of ordinary pattern, but it's quite understandable. Even though we don't have morphological clues to tell us, we intuitively know that this sentence is not to be "read straight through".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man bites dog.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, context informs our understanding. Here, the (seeming!) inversion is nòt used for poetic effect, but is instead the epitome of the ironically prosaic. In this case, the context is journalism and headline writing style and is a commentary on what is newsworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I don't know Vulcan, however I might be able to help you with your interpretation of the English:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"worth having is" isn't quite the string of verbs you might think it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, "worth having" is modifying the preceding noun phrase, rather than being part of some grouping with "is". This can most easily be shown by rearranging the sentence as such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To know one's own mind is the one self-knowledge worth having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, "worth" here is an adjective¹. It might help to expand the phrase out to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"The one self-knowledge &lt;em&gt;that is&lt;/em&gt; worth (one's) having."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¹ - "worth" is most commonly described as an adjective, however it does have some qualities which lead some to classify it as a preposition. For more detail see &lt;a href="http://people.brandeis.edu/~maling/Maling1983_adjectives.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Joan Maling, 1983, "Transitive Adjectives: A Case of Categorial Reanalysis"&lt;/a&gt;, pages 268-269.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The key principle to understanding what is being uttered or has been written is to know how to put the words into a structural context. This is often explained in simple terms using the W questions: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;ho&lt;/em&gt; is doing something, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;hat&lt;/em&gt; are they doing, &lt;em&gt;ho&lt;strong&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are they doing it, &lt;em&gt;to &lt;strong&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;hom&lt;/em&gt; are they doing it, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;hen&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; are they doing it, etc. In grammatical terms, these can be labelled as subject, verb, adverbs, objects, adverbials and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some languages, quite a few categories are distinguishable &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; just by their ending. For example in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;, singular nouns are marked with terminal &lt;em&gt;-o&lt;/em&gt;, adjectives end in &lt;em&gt;-a&lt;/em&gt; and conjugated verbs usually in &lt;em&gt;-[vowel]s&lt;/em&gt;. Likewise, a general knowledge of the conjugation tables of Finnish often allows a quick and dirty rough estimate whether a word happens to a noun or adjective or a verb form. English is generally terrible at this distinction with a number of words being written and pronounced the same regardless of the category (see: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what is mentioned in the paragraph above only accounts for the word type; if a sentence has two nouns we may not immediately be able to distinguish between the subject noun and the object noun without additional information. Thus, languages generally use one of two methods to clarify what exactly is meant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information is encoded in word order. This is often the rule for languages with rather low levels of inflection such as English or Chinese. In English, the following two sentences are different because of the different subject and object functions even though all the words are the same:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The man bites the dog.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The dog bites the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information is encoded in inflection, prepositions, participles, suffixes and the like. While very likely all languages make use of this scheme partially, some do to a much larger extent than English; for example German or Finnish. In German and Finnish, the following two sentences with the same words but different order mean &lt;em&gt;the same:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Der Mann beißt den Hund.&lt;br&gt;
  Mies puree koiraa.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Den Hund beißt der Mann.&lt;br&gt;
  Koiraa puree mies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’m not sure if the second Finnish example is strictly allowed in that way; however, my Finnish course includes a  similar precedence of an OVS sentence).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By marking the nouns according to case — and thus, according to their grammatic function — we have one clear subject (the agent, the man; nominative case in both examples) and one clear object (the patient, the dog; accusative or partitive case). Once the relation between the two is established like this, one is typically free to move the components around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than using declension by case, modifiers can be placed around a word. In Japanese, that would be the particles が, は, を, に, へ and others. The word or phrase that precedes the particle が is understood to be the subject of a sentence, whatever precedes を is an object. In theory, this would allow the parts suffixed in that way to be moved around as seen fit. (Whether Japanese actually does that I do not know as my knowledge of it is still too basic.) Other options of the same general flavour include prepositions: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; the house&lt;/em&gt; shows that the house is used to denote location and is not an agent or a patient of the sentence. Even in the otherwise relatively strict word order of English, adverbials such as that can be moved around to a certain degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Languages that allow a more or less free word order will not rely on word order to assign syntactical roles. Instead, markers or modifiers of certain types will likely be used; cases and declension being a rather common choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that in addition to relying heavily on one strategy, it's also possible to mix strategies is various different ways, relying on different strategies to back each other up. For example in Fore(Kainantu-Goroka(TNG), PNG), there is a hierarchy like this, where if each strategy fails, the one lower in the list can be relied on. I'm putting "case" in quotation marks, because the "ergative" case marker in Fore is not really a case-marker as much as it is an often optional and occasionally prohibited derivational marker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verbal agreement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Case"-marking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Word order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point 2, "animacy" means that referents higher on the animacy hierarchy are interpreted as being more likely to be agents, as such the NPs in a sentence like &lt;em&gt;aebá nanita: yaga: amiye&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;he pig food 3sg:gave_to:3sg&lt;/code&gt; "he gave the pig food" can be freely reordered without a change in truth value, despite the fact that the verbal agreement is wholly inadequate to disambiguate the roles of the participants. Only in the few instances where the other strategies fail is word order a primary disambiguative device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some languages where a primary disambiguation strategy is marking on the verb whether such a hierarchy a broken or not, called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct%E2%80%93inverse_language" rel="noreferrer"&gt;direct/inverse marking&lt;/a&gt; (this can disambiguate situations with two 3rd persons of equal animacy as well by considering e.g. topicality or obviation).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Lojban started as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relexification" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;relexification&lt;/a&gt; of Loglan but it has evolved independently from Loglan since that starting point. I don't think that the two languages can be considered dialects of each other because there is no mutual understandability left because every single word of Loglan was replaced with something different in Lojban (with the famous exception of the word &lt;em&gt;blanu&lt;/em&gt; "blue").&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;International Auxiliary Languages are very, very ambitious, and probably bound to fail on a large scale. However, it seems plausible to me that there might be some corners of the world where an auxlang might be used to facilitate communication between more localized groups, much like English is used in many parts of Europe (and really, the world) for this purpose. But does this actually occur anywhere?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I know of one very localized example myself: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romansh_language#Rumantsch_Grischun" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Rumantsch Grischun&lt;/a&gt; is a constructed variety of the Romansh language which tries to unify the dialect continuum. It is the variety of the language used in official texts and also in some schools and media, but the population in general is rather unhappy about this status quo and prefers using either their own dialects, or Swiss German if that fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, some consider Modern Hebrew a conlang, and it does serve as a lingua franca between various Jewish populations. But this is definitely a less prototypical example.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The line between "conlang" and "supradialectal standard" can get incredibly fuzzy. You mention Rumantsch Grischun and Modern Hebrew yourself, something along similar lines, but much more successful in terms of number of speakers is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Bahasa Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. Any number of other supradialectal standards depending on how strict you are with drawing the line may fall under this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to supradialectal standards, another thing that may or may not be considered a conlang is controlled languages, such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Technical_English" rel="noreferrer"&gt;ASD STE-100 Simplified Technical English&lt;/a&gt; which see some use in various technical documents (but aren't really spoken).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Lojban vocabulary was deliberately constructed from scratch, in an attempt to get around &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cooke_Brown" rel="noreferrer"&gt;James Brown's&lt;/a&gt; copyright on Loglan (Brown was the creator of Loglan, but continued to retain control over it. The Logical Language Group was formed to reinvent the words, beginning in the late 1980s, while retaining Loglan's grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The words LLG created are the &lt;a href="https://lojban.github.io/cll/4/4/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;gismu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the roots that make up Lojban. They generated over 1300 of them, taking source words from Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, Russian and Arabic and scored many potential gismu by their similarities with the source words. The highest-scoring gismu were used; from there, the rest of the vocabulary was generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this was similar to &lt;a href="http://members.home.nl/w.dijkhuis/loglan_jcb/Brown_JC_loglan.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Brown's original process&lt;/a&gt;, although he used Japanese, French and German as three more reference languages, while leaving out Arabic. This algorithm was quite similar to the one used to generate Lojban's gisme. Brown's scores - and, in a sense, the LLG's - were explicitly based on learnability, which is why these languages were used. However, the implementation of the Logban algorithm resulted in a completely new lexicon, due to different weightings, quantification of similarity, and the differing source languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the relexification, the grammar of Lojban has changed in certain ways. While it would have been easier for speakers of Loglan to learn shortly after its inception, it has now diverged enough that the two languages, while based on the same principles, are now very different. I think the analogy of Anglo-Saxon and English is a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Many natlangs have irregular verbs that do not follow the same patterns as the majority of verbs, often as a product of old verb patterns that are no longer used. Some of the benefits of not having irregular verbs are an easier to learn and interpret conlang, but are there benefits, such as giving a sense that the language has changed over time?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Depends on what your goal is. If you want to create an auxlang, then you should have few, if any irregular verbs. If you want naturalism, then most natlangs have at least one irregular verb, though the exact number varies widely. Also consider &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_and_irregular_verbs" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;how your irregular verbs will arise.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;An invented language &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have in it what the glossopoet wants to put in it. Regardless of which point of the &lt;a href="http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Glosso/Glossopoeia.html#gnoli-triang" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triangle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; your language most closely identifies with, there is plenty of room for whatever you might want to put in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yes, indeed, be it auxlang or artlang or engelang, an invented language shòuld have irregular verbs (irregular nouns, irregular adverbs, irregular interjections, etc) if that's what is required by the language for it to be true to itself within its context and also be an accurate projection of the glossopoet's vision for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet also, no, indeed, be it auxlang or artlang or engelang, an invented language should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; have irregular forms of any kind. If they cause the language to run afoul of its creator's vision for it, then they are inappropriate to the work of art being created. Or if such irregularities would in any way foul up the language's subcreated realism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some respects, there may be matters of taste or audience expectation involved. For example, I think most language inventors would argue that auxlangs should be as irregularity free as possible. I'd argue the opposite, but that is indeed a matter of taste and sense of plausibility. Perhaps also a nod to a future where the auxlang in question shall have conquered all others and taken its rightful place as the naturalised L2 of the entire world. Irregularities are bound to creep into such a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no particular benefit one way or the other &lt;em&gt;external to the invented language&lt;/em&gt;. I don't think a perfectly regular system is any easier to learn. It's not inherently better to be irregularity free. &lt;em&gt;Within the language&lt;/em&gt;, it might be argued that verisimilitude and plausibility (leastways of human language) demand some amount of irregularity. Surely that might be seen as a benefit, perhaps for a language within a fictional setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yeah. Put em in or leave em out. Dealer's choice. Six of one, half dozen of the other! There is no right or wrong answer here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Irregular verbs are naturalistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, even an international auxiliary language, namely IALA Interlingua, has irregular verbs to match its Romance source languages (that are famous for their wealth of irregular verbs mostly directly inherited from Latin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irregularities add flavour to your conlang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They make the conlang as a whole more interesting and create some esthetic effect. It also shows that the conlang designer has spent some more time to make Eir creation not too schematic.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The Latin verb has four &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_parts" rel="noreferrer"&gt;principal parts&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., &lt;em&gt;ducere, duco, duxi, ductum&lt;/em&gt;) that are sufficient and necessary to create all inflected forms and derived words from it. As far as I know, no naturalistic conlang attempts to preserve the French &lt;em&gt;passé simple&lt;/em&gt; and related tempora in other Romance languages; so we can drop this one. Usually, the differences between infinitives and present tense forms are also levelled out by dropping most of the Romance verbal inflections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves us with two principal parts, one for the infinitive, present tense and past tense, and one for the past participle (or at least for derivations from the past participle, in case that the participle is somehow regularised).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember that Edgar de Wahl even went further in his design of Occidental-Interlingue using a device called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Wahl%27s_rule" rel="noreferrer"&gt;de Wahl's rule&lt;/a&gt; (the description in the Wikipedia differs somewhat from my presentation) in deriving also the infinitive and the present tense stem from the past particple, so his word for "to lead" is &lt;em&gt;ducter&lt;/em&gt;. He isn't 100% consequent, but this adds a lot of regularity to his design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do other Romance-based conlangs deal with the principal parts?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are three main strategies for indicating grammatical relations in languages with free word orders. It is common for languages to have more than one of these, and to my knowledge all free word order natural languages have either case or verbal agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case refers to grammatical markers attached to nouns which indicate the noun's role in the sentence. Some languages have a very large number of cases, but in general you can expect such a language to have at least two cases: nominative and accusative, or ergative and absolutive. Here is an example from &lt;a href="http://www.ausil.org.au/sites/ausil/files/WP-B-1%20Walmatjari%20-Part%202_0.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Walmajarri&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parri-ngu  pa   manga-Ø   nyanya
boy-subj   AUX  girl-obj  saw
'The boy saw the girl.'

parri-Ø  pa   nyanya  manga-ngu
boy-obj  AUX  saw     girl-subj
'The girl saw the boy.'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Walmajarri &lt;code&gt;ngu&lt;/code&gt; is the ergative case marker. Walmajarri has a null absolutive case marker, shown here as &lt;code&gt;Ø&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_(linguistics)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Agreement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second strategy is agreement, where markers are attached to the verb to give information about the subject and object. Depending on the language, these markers might indicate the person, number, or gender of each noun. Here's an example, again from &lt;a href="http://ausil.org.au/sites/ausil/files/WP-B-1%20Walmatjari%20-Part%201_0.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Walmajarri&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nayili  nya-ka-kyaka-ji-pila
north   see-IRR-REDUP-1sgO-3dlS
'You two watch out for me in the north.'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the verb has two suffixes (actually clitics), &lt;code&gt;-ji&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-pila&lt;/code&gt;, which mean a 1st person singular object, and a 3rd person dual subject. While it is most common for these verbal agreement markers to be attached to the verbs, in some languages they are attached to other elements in the sentence. In Walmajarri the most common sentence form actually has these markers attaching to a modal auxiliary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ngayirta  ma-rnalu     majurra  kang-ka-rla
NEG       AUX-1plincS  matches  carry-IRR-PAST
'We didn't take matches.'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;ma&lt;/code&gt; is the unmarked modal auxiliary, to which &lt;code&gt;-rnalu&lt;/code&gt; is attached, the marker for a 1st person plural inclusive subject. Matches is a third person singular object and so has a null marker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(linguistics)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Incorporation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third strategy is incorporation, where a language productively forms compound words where the verb includes the object. English doesn't do this very productively - our compounds are more like individual set combinations. So in the verb &lt;em&gt;babysit&lt;/em&gt; the object &lt;em&gt;baby&lt;/em&gt; is incorporated, but the meaning of the compound is not obviously derived from its component parts. In incorporating languages this process happens productively with the components often keeping their normal sense. Here is an example from &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118358733.wbsyncom093/full" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nuu-chah-nulth&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;maḥt'a-ʔa-mit-ʔiš    čakup   
house-buy-past-3ind  man     
'A man bought a house.'

ʔu-ʔaa-mit-ʔiš    maḥt'ii  čakup
Ø-buy-past-3.ind  house    man
'A man bought a house.'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuu-chah-nulth is called an obligatory incorporating language because if the object is not incorporated a dummy morpheme &lt;code&gt;ʔu&lt;/code&gt; must be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now while incorporation is used in many languages, we have to be careful about making generalisations as each language incorporates nouns according to its own rules. Some incorporate adjectives, and some don't. Or for example, in &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118358733.wbsyncom093/full" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nahuatl&lt;/a&gt; an independent noun indicates a specific event, whereas an incorporated noun indicates a more general or habitual meaning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ni-c-qua  in   nacatl
I-it-eat  the  flesh
'I eat the flesh.' [particular act]

ni-naca-qua
I-flesh-eat
'I eat flesh' or 'I am a flesh-eater.'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A free word order conlang could require incorporation of all objects and not use either case or agreement, a typological combination that does not exist in natlangs to my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;There are three main strategies for indicating grammatical relations in languages with free word orders. It is common for languages to have more than one of these, and to my knowledge all free word order natural languages have either case or verbal agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case refers to grammatical markers attached to nouns which indicate the noun's role in the sentence. Some languages have a very large number of cases, but in general you can expect such a language to have at least two cases: nominative and accusative, or ergative and absolutive. Here is an example from &lt;a href="http://www.ausil.org.au/sites/ausil/files/WP-B-1%20Walmatjari%20-Part%202_0.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Walmajarri&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parri-ngu  pa   manga-Ø   nyanya
boy-subj   AUX  girl-obj  saw
'The boy saw the girl.'

parri-Ø  pa   nyanya  manga-ngu
boy-obj  AUX  saw     girl-subj
'The girl saw the boy.'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Walmajarri &lt;code&gt;ngu&lt;/code&gt; is the ergative case marker. Walmajarri has a null absolutive case marker, shown here as &lt;code&gt;Ø&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_(linguistics)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Agreement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second strategy is agreement, where markers are attached to the verb to give information about the subject and object. Depending on the language, these markers might indicate the person, number, or gender of each noun. Here's an example, again from &lt;a href="http://ausil.org.au/sites/ausil/files/WP-B-1%20Walmatjari%20-Part%201_0.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Walmajarri&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nayili  nya-ka-kyaka-ji-pila
north   see-IRR-REDUP-1sgO-3dlS
'You two watch out for me in the north.'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the verb has two suffixes (actually clitics), &lt;code&gt;-ji&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-pila&lt;/code&gt;, which mean a 1st person singular object, and a 3rd person dual subject. While it is most common for these verbal agreement markers to be attached to the verbs, in some languages they are attached to other elements in the sentence. In Walmajarri the most common sentence form actually has these markers attaching to a modal auxiliary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ngayirta  ma-rnalu     majurra  kang-ka-rla
NEG       AUX-1plincS  matches  carry-IRR-PAST
'We didn't take matches.'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;ma&lt;/code&gt; is the unmarked modal auxiliary, to which &lt;code&gt;-rnalu&lt;/code&gt; is attached, the marker for a 1st person plural inclusive subject. Matches is a third person singular object and so has a null marker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(linguistics)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Incorporation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third strategy is incorporation, where a language productively forms compound words where the verb includes the object. English doesn't do this very productively - our compounds are more like individual set combinations. So in the verb &lt;em&gt;babysit&lt;/em&gt; the object &lt;em&gt;baby&lt;/em&gt; is incorporated, but the meaning of the compound is not obviously derived from its component parts.

Here is an example from &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118358733.wbsyncom093/full" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nuu-chah-nulth&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;maḥt'a-ʔa-mit-ʔiš    čakup   
house-buy-past-3ind  man     
'A man bought a house.'

ʔu-ʔaa-mit-ʔiš    maḥt'ii  čakup
Ø-buy-past-3.ind  house    man
'A man bought a house.'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuu-chah-nulth is called an obligatory incorporating language because if the object is not incorporated a dummy morpheme &lt;code&gt;ʔu&lt;/code&gt; must be used.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t personally call Anglish (that is, English without non-Germanic (or sometimes even non-Anglosaxon) vocabulary) a conlang. Taken at face value, it replaces English vocabulary 1:1 with coined words, which is basically the definition of a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relexification#Conlangs_and_jargon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;relex&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you want to consider relexes a subset of conlangs or an entirely different category (perhaps a subset of ciphers and codes) altogether is subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a note, Anglish can also just be stylistic in nature — favouring germanic word stems over loaned ones where possible, but in the context of the essay you posted this is clearly not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm going to disagree with Adarain and say that Anglish might be a conlang in instances where it is used to as full an extent as in Uncleftish Beholding, though I think it pretty much straddles the line between relex and full conlang. In something where the preference for Germanic word stems is more of a preference than a hard-and-fast rule, it's definitely not a conlang, so those are disregarded for this discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is true that Anglish is pretty damn relex-y and to my knowledge doesn't change any Modern English syntactic rules (although if it did, it would undeniably be a conlang), but I do think it does some things differently than more transparent relexes. The word "uncleftish" certainly breaks the rules of Modern English morphology, and extensions of sense, as in using "motes" to refer to particles, give opportunities for the semantic space to change quite a bit (I don't know to what extent the author took advantage of this, however). It depends a lot on an individual's use of the language whether it leans closer to being a conlang or a relex.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;When discussing tense, aspect, and mood, it's important to distinguish a given language's grammatical markers from the abstract concepts being described. Thus, linguists use the words &lt;strong&gt;temporal reference&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;aspectual reference&lt;/strong&gt; to describe the abstract ideas being described, while the words &lt;strong&gt;tense&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;aspect&lt;/strong&gt; are reserved for when such reference is marked grammatically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplified explanation for tense and aspect usually given is that tense describes when an event occurs and aspect describes the internal temporal structure of an event. However, this doesn't give a ton of easy answers to "is this grammatical form marking tense, aspect, or both?" Formal semanticists actually have a relatively simple framework for how temporal reference and aspectual reference are defined, the basic concepts of which can be helpful when designing your conlang's own tense/aspect system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Neo-Reichenbachian Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a timeline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Earlier                                  Later
&lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine there are two spans on that timeline (the fact that they're spans is important -- nothing is truly instantaneous). The time when you make an utterance is called the &lt;strong&gt;utterance time&lt;/strong&gt; (or UT), and the time that you're talking &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; is called the &lt;strong&gt;topic time&lt;/strong&gt; (or TT). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporal reference describes the relationship between the TT and UT&lt;/strong&gt;. Past temporal reference is when the TT precedes the UT; future temporal reference when the TT follows the UT; and present temporal reference when they overlap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Past:
    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
                |--TT--|          |--UT--|

Future:
    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
          |--UT--|                  |--TT--|

Present:
                            |--UT--|
    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
                     |-------TT-------|
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems pretty intuitive -- if the section of the timeline you're talking about precedes the time you make the utterance, you'll use the past tense; if it follows it, you'll use the future; and if they overlap, you'll use the present. Simple, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what of aspect? Well, aspectual reference isn't as transparent at that. To describe aspectual reference, we'll need to pick out a third span that timeline -- the time when the event being described actually happened. We'll call this the &lt;strong&gt;eventuality time&lt;/strong&gt; (or ET).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But wait!" you might object. "Isn't that the same as the topic time? If I'm describing something that happened, surely the time I was talking about is the same as the time that it happened." However, there is a difference, and it's exactly this difference that gives rise to aspectual reference. Consider the English past perfect in a sentence like the following: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yesterday he had gone to the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English past tense includes past temporal reference, and we've established that this means that the topic time is before the utterance time -- something which is explicitly confirmed by the temporal adverb "yesterday" giving us a more specific topic time. But when does the him-going-to-the-store happen? Probably not yesterday, right? Well, this is because perfect† aspectual reference is when the &lt;em&gt;eventuality time&lt;/em&gt; precedes the &lt;em&gt;topic time&lt;/em&gt; -- &lt;strong&gt;aspectual reference describes the relationship between the eventuality time and the topic time&lt;/strong&gt;. It for this reason that the past perfect is used by English speakers for the past-in-past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Past Perfect:
    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
          |--ET--|    |--TT--|     |--UT--|
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can also have the present perfect, right? Well, let's combine our descriptions of the present tense and the perfect aspect and see what we come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Present Perfect:
                            |--UT--|
    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
        |--ET--|     |-------TT-------|
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the topic time and utterance time overlap, which is why you can't say something like "Yesterday he has gone to the store." However, the eventuality time precedes the topic time, so &lt;em&gt;you're describing an event that happened in the past in relation to the present&lt;/em&gt;. And indeed, this is how we see the present perfect used in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is far from the most interesting thing aspectual reference can do, however. Let's discuss the popular aspectual references, perfective and imperfect. For those who don't know, perfective and perfect are two different things. Perfective is often described as simply viewing an event as a point on a timeline, and imperfect as viewing it as a span. How do we define this as a relationship between eventuality time and topic time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, a simple way people do it (ignoring a few other related thorny semantic problems that few here will care about) is by defining the perfective as when the eventuality time is contained within the topic time and the imperfect as when the topic time is contained within the eventuality time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Past Perfective:
               |--ET--|
    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
        |-------TT-------|        |--UT--|     

Past Imperfect:
               |--TT--|
    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
        |-------ET-------|        |--UT--|     
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results, at least formally, in the same sort of perspective shift we try to intuitively describe as changing the event from a "point" to a "span".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that tense and aspect vary between languages a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;, and even related languages can't be counted upon to have the same semantics here. After all, the French passé composé, while very similar in form to the English present perfect, does not share the same semantics (it's more of a perfective). Additionally, while a given language's system of tense and aspect will often combine a tense and an aspect in a certain inflection (such as the perfective past tenses in many European languages), this doesn't mean the two are wed cross-linguistically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I hope this answer has given some conlangers the tools to try and invent their own tenses, aspects, or combinations of the two that they haven't themselves encountered cross-linguistically. Be creative!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In short:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temporal reference is the relationship between the utterance time (when you say something) and the topic time (the time relevant to the discussion at hand).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aspectual reference is the relationship between the topic time (see above) and the eventuality time (the time when the event being described actually occured).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tense is the grammaticalization of temporal reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aspect is the grammaticalization of aspectual reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things called "tenses" in natural languages (as well as in conlangs, to be honest) are often conflations of tense and aspect (and sometimes even mood, but we're not here to talk about that).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;†When I refer to perfect aspectual reference, I'm actually more specifically describing what is known in semantics as the existential perfect. Perfect forms in English and many other languages include other types of perfect aspectual reference (universal, resultive, etc.) that differ subtly in their semantics, and other aspectual and temporal baggage as well; this is, however, probably not particularly interesting or relevant to most people here at this moment. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;When discussing tense, aspect, and mood, it's important to distinguish a given language's grammatical markers from the abstract concepts being described. Thus, linguists use the words &lt;strong&gt;temporal reference&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;aspectual reference&lt;/strong&gt; to describe the abstract ideas being described, while the words &lt;strong&gt;tense&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;aspect&lt;/strong&gt; are reserved for when such reference is marked grammatically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplified explanation for tense and aspect usually given is that tense describes when an event occurs and aspect describes the internal temporal structure of an event. However, this doesn't give a ton of easy answers to "is this grammatical form marking tense, aspect, or both?" Formal semanticists actually have a relatively simple framework for how temporal reference and aspectual reference are defined, the basic concepts of which can be helpful when designing your conlang's own tense/aspect system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Neo-Reichenbachian Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a timeline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Earlier                                  Later
&lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine there are two spans on that timeline (the fact that they're spans is important -- nothing is truly instantaneous). The time when you make an utterance is called the &lt;strong&gt;utterance time&lt;/strong&gt; (or UT), and the time that you're talking &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; is called the &lt;strong&gt;topic time&lt;/strong&gt; (or TT). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporal reference describes the relationship between the TT and UT&lt;/strong&gt;. Past temporal reference is when the TT precedes the UT; future temporal reference when the TT follows the UT; and present temporal reference when they overlap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Past:
    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
                |--TT--|          |--UT--|

Future:
    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
          |--UT--|                  |--TT--|

Present:
                            |--UT--|
    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
                     |-------TT-------|
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems pretty intuitive -- if the section of the timeline you're talking about precedes the time you make the utterance, you'll use the past tense; if it follows it, you'll use the future; and if they overlap, you'll use the present. Simple, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what of aspect? Well, aspectual reference isn't as transparent at that. To describe aspectual reference, we'll need to pick out a third span that timeline -- the time when the event being described actually happened. We'll call this the &lt;strong&gt;eventuality time&lt;/strong&gt; (or ET).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But wait!" you might object. "Isn't that the same as the topic time? If I'm describing something that happened, surely the time I was talking about is the same as the time that it happened." However, there is a difference, and it's exactly this difference that gives rise to aspectual reference. Consider the English past perfect in a sentence like the following: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yesterday he had gone to the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English past tense includes past temporal reference, and we've established that this means that the topic time is before the utterance time -- something which is explicitly confirmed by the temporal adverb "yesterday" giving us a more specific topic time. But when does the him-going-to-the-store happen? Probably not yesterday, right? Well, this is because perfect† aspectual reference is when the &lt;em&gt;eventuality time&lt;/em&gt; precedes the &lt;em&gt;topic time&lt;/em&gt; -- &lt;strong&gt;aspectual reference describes the relationship between the eventuality time and the topic time&lt;/strong&gt;. It for this reason that the past perfect is used by English speakers for the past-in-past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Past Perfect:
    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
          |--ET--|    |--TT--|     |--UT--|
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can also have the present perfect, right? Well, let's combine our descriptions of the present tense and the perfect aspect and see what we come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Present Perfect:
                            |--UT--|
    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
        |--ET--|     |-------TT-------|
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the topic time and utterance time overlap, which is why you can't say something like "Yesterday he has gone to the store." However, the eventuality time precedes the topic time, so &lt;em&gt;you're describing an event that happened in the past in relation to the present&lt;/em&gt;. And indeed, this is how we see the present perfect used in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is far from the most interesting thing aspectual reference can do, however. Let's discuss the popular aspectual references, perfective and imperfect.

               |--ET--|
    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
        |-------TT-------|        |--UT--|     

Past Imperfect:
               |--TT--|
    &lt;--------------------------------------------&gt;
        |-------ET-------|        |--UT--|     
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anglish&lt;/strong&gt; is neither invented language nor relex nor just a casual / funny "style".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, more than anything else, a &lt;em&gt;register&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/types-of-english-formal-informal-etc/register" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cambridge Dictionary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says of register: &lt;em&gt;We use the term ‘register’ to refer to particular varieties or styles of speaking and writing. Registers vary because the language is used for different purposes, in different contexts and for different audiences. For example, there is a legal register, a register of advertising, registers of banking and a register of weather forecasting. We commonly recognise registers because of their specialised vocabulary but also because of particular uses of grammar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like how we have registers for differing social contexts ("street talk" or "formal gatherings" or "liturgical worship"), Anglish is simply another register. In this case, I'd argue that the social context is one of distinct national identity vs worldwide loss of identity. Anglish is clearly a distinct variety or style of English --- it is &lt;em&gt;English&lt;/em&gt; pure and simple! --- and it is used for the particular purpose of distinguishing English English (&lt;em&gt;Our English&lt;/em&gt;) from World English (&lt;em&gt;Everyone's English&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://anglish.wikia.com/wiki/What_is_Anglish%3F" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anglish Moot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; goes into some detail here. &lt;em&gt;The Anglish/New English project is intended as a means of recovering the Englishness of English and of restoring ownership of the language to the English people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In linguistics, a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;register&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is simply a "variety of a language used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting." In the case of Anglish, the purpose is as stated: to communicate using a &lt;em&gt;restored &amp; nativising&lt;/em&gt; form of English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an artifact, it can't really be called an &lt;em&gt;invented language&lt;/em&gt;, because it isn't really a thing "invented". And certainly not in the usually understood sense of the concept of an invented language. For it is already &lt;em&gt;English&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not a &lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/Conlang_terminology#Descriptive_terms_for_conlangs" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;relex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the conlinguistic sense because it is not a matter of "making up new words" and replacing the English words one for one. (In the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relexification" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;linguistic sense&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps.) Anglish is a matter, simply, of bringing actual English words, older words, dialect words, disused words to the forefront along with some loan borrowing and calquing from other Germanic languages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My vote is still for Anglish to be classified a &lt;strong&gt;Register of English&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I answer first for two of my own invented languages, &lt;strong&gt;Kerno&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Loucarian&lt;/strong&gt;. Since the question is now broadened to invented IALs, I choose to add several additional sections: &lt;strong&gt;Interlingua&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sabir&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Occidental&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Romanal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Medial Europan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Lingua Franca Nova&lt;/strong&gt;. Also, just so one can get a flavour of these languages, I append the Pater Noster in each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back at some of my old Romance languages, I don't think I paid much attention to the Latin principle parts as a system. As the languages evolve out of Latin and into their more modern selves, the systematic nature might fall apart or accrete new forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/Kerno" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kerno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we can certainly see the survival of at least three principal parts for the regular verbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cantam, cantar, cantú&lt;/strong&gt; (sing)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;caru, carer, carú&lt;/strong&gt; (love)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;dormu, dormir, dormú&lt;/strong&gt; (sleep)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not until we meet up with those good old irregular verbs that more principal parts seem to linger:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Grammar, there is actually a section that lists the principal parts of the irregular verbs (though for some unknown reason, I didn't call them such):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;doc (or doy), dar, dedai, doú&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;istam, ystar, stetai, ystú&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;currem, currer, coscorrai (or cocorrai), cursú&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;llodu, lloder, llosès, llosú&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ioc, ir, fu, eú&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;sentu, sentir, senti, sentú&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, four principal parts surviving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a Phazeoir Nusteor que bias 'n y ceues;&lt;br&gt;
foreth noef il tew nom;&lt;br&gt;
gouenyes il tew camouils;&lt;br&gt;
foreth fès la teva gouoluntáts&lt;br&gt;
en lâ derra cuomo 'ny ceues;&lt;br&gt;
danos-el osdia le nusteor panèn cuotidièn;&lt;br&gt;
dimeti y nusteor dheuz&lt;br&gt;
cuomo dimitemus ai nusteor dheutoeres;&lt;br&gt;
et ne nus attrayer rhen al tentación,&lt;br&gt;
mays eliveránus des val.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/Lucarian" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loucarian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; takes its inspiration from Sabir and has a similarly reduced verbal conjugation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amare, amando, amato&lt;br&gt;
clevere, cleviendo, cleveto&lt;br&gt;
ajire, ajiendo, ajito&lt;br&gt;
pejeire, pejiendo, pejito&lt;br&gt;
vidure, videndo, viduto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a principal part of the ancestral Reman language, modern Loucarian takes the present/infinitive, progressive/continual &amp; past for its principal parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nemet sospeito pôdis IC cata maccareire; etti pejeto IC:&lt;br&gt;
enamverver tim maccareire coudeiere ican:&lt;br&gt;
jenì abba en samayam na&lt;br&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All personal inflexion is stripped off, so there can be no "first principal part" as such. However, the Latin present stem remains largely intact, so the I-a present tense could continue to serve as first principal part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The infinitive remains distinct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old Latin perfect stems have all been obliterated; the I-a past tense is formed upon the Latin imperfect (present stem), so there can be no "third principal part".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Latin past participle remains in I-a.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could say the principal parts of an Interlingua verb are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;parla, parlar, parlate&lt;br&gt;
dice, dicer, dicíte&lt;br&gt;
senti, sentir, séntite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interlingua is not entirely regular as regards its verbal system. There are a few (unofficial) irregulars (thank Goodness!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal parts of esser are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;es, esser, era, essite&lt;/strong&gt; thus four principal parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nostre Patre, qui es in le celos,&lt;br&gt;
que tu nomine sia sanctificate;&lt;br&gt;
que tu regno veni;&lt;br&gt;
que tu voluntate sia facite&lt;br&gt;
super le terra como etiam in le celo.&lt;br&gt;
Da nos hodie nostre pan quotidian,&lt;br&gt;
e pardona a nos nostre debitas&lt;br&gt;
como nos pardona a nostre debitores,&lt;br&gt;
e non duce nos in tentation,&lt;br&gt;
sed libera nos del mal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/Lingua_Franca" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sabir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (also knows as Mediterranean Lingua Franca) was an actual, natural Romance IAL in use within the Mediterranean Sea basin from the middle ages onwards to about the mid 19th century or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is well known for severe reduction &amp; levelling of morphology in general. There are but two principal parts, both surviving from Latin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;parlar, parlato&lt;br&gt;
fazer, fazeto&lt;br&gt;
sabir, sabito&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present tense, imperative and infinitive are all wrapped within the immutable infinitive; the past and past participle are wrapped up within the old perfect participle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple odd forms. For example, in the Pater Noster we find &lt;em&gt;noi volir ki nomi di ti star &lt;strong&gt;saluti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of which I (having no grammar of the language available) can only imagine to be a past participle of saluer. Why the -i termination and why not "salueto", I don't know. Obviously Sabir was not &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to level all irregularity. It evolved naturally and over a long period of time within a broad geographical region. Oddities are bound to survive / arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Padri di noi, ki star in syelo,&lt;br&gt;
noi volir ki nomi di ti star saluti.&lt;br&gt;
Noi volir ki il paisi di ti star kon noi,&lt;br&gt;
i ki ti lasar ki tuto il populo fazer volo di ti&lt;br&gt;
na tera, syemi syemi ki nel syelo.&lt;br&gt;
Dar noi sempri pani di noi di kada jorno,&lt;br&gt;
i skuzar per noi li kulpa di noi,&lt;br&gt;
syemi syemi ki noi skuzar kwesto populo ki fazer kulpa a noi.&lt;br&gt;
Non lasar noi tenir katibo pensyeri,&lt;br&gt;
ma tradir per noi di malu.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occidental_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occidental&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is another invented Romance IAL. I really don't know much about it beyond a couple articles I've read online. Even so, we can easily pick out the remaining principal parts from a good sample text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;da, dar, dat&lt;br&gt;
inducte, inducter, inductet&lt;br&gt;
veni, venir, venit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with Interlingua and Sabir, the morphology of person is eliminated, leaving only a present stem. Also, the perfect stem itself is eliminated. This leaves us three principal parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patre nor, qui es in li cieles,&lt;br&gt;
mey tui nómine esser sanctificat,&lt;br&gt;
mey tui regnia venir,&lt;br&gt;
mey tui vole esser fat,&lt;br&gt;
qualmen in li cieles talmen anc sur li terre.&lt;br&gt;
Da nos hodie nor pan omnidial,&lt;br&gt;
e pardona nor débites,&lt;br&gt;
qualmen anc noi pardona nor debitores.&lt;br&gt;
E ne inducte nos in tentation,&lt;br&gt;
ma libera nos de lu mal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/Romanal" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romanal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was another invented Romance IAL. I have again no reference grammar, but a perusal of a text shows some interesting morphology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;das, dar, dat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forms like &lt;em&gt;ne nos inducas&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dimitta&lt;/em&gt; speak of the survival of Latin negative imperative and possibly imperative forms as well. Romanal is well worth the visit for the spiffy verbal conjugation alone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patro nostri,&lt;br&gt;
qui est en cieles,&lt;br&gt;
sanctificat estas nomine tui,&lt;br&gt;
advenias regne tui,&lt;br&gt;
fias volite tui,&lt;br&gt;
sicut en ciele, et en terre.&lt;br&gt;
Il pane nostri quotidiani das ad nos hodie,&lt;br&gt;
et dimittas nostri debites,&lt;br&gt;
sicut et nus dimitta debitantos nostri,&lt;br&gt;
et ne nos inducas in tentatione,&lt;br&gt;
sed liberas nos ex male.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/Medial_Europan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medial Europan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was another invented Romance IAL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would seem, from the given text, that all distinctions of conjugation have been reduced to but one. We can see that the present tense and infinitive are distinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pintit, pintir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Un englo, un franco ed un deuto havit le taske pintir kamele. Le englo voyajit ad Afrike for studiir le kamele in tisui doimie. Le franco gidit al zoologi jarden, ed le deuto pintit on kamelo ex le profunde de sui psyke.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_Franca_Nova_grammar#Verbs" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lingua Franca Nova&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was also inspired by Sabir. Its verbal system is the most reduced respecting the old Latin principal parts. That is to say, there are no principal parts, the bare verb stem being used for all tenses, in conjunction with temporal particles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;leva&lt;br&gt;
come&lt;br&gt;
boli&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nosa Padre ci es en la sielo,&lt;br&gt;
Ta ce tua nom es santida.&lt;br&gt;
Ta ce tua rena veni.&lt;br&gt;
Ta ce tua vole aveni&lt;br&gt;
sur la tera como en la sielo.&lt;br&gt;
Dona oji nosa pan dial a nos,&lt;br&gt;
e pardona nosa detas,&lt;br&gt;
como nos pardona nosa detores,&lt;br&gt;
e no condui nos a tenta,&lt;br&gt;
ma libri nos de malia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NB:&lt;/strong&gt; I deliberately left out Esperanto / Ido because, while their vocabulary is largely paneuropean, its grammar is not Romance. (I've read several sources that claim it is closer to Slavic grammatically.) Also, I leave out Novial for the same reason, only its grammar is much closer to that of English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;I answer first for two of my own invented languages, &lt;strong&gt;Kerno&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Loucarian&lt;/strong&gt;. Since the question is now broadened to invented IALs, I choose to add several additional sections: &lt;strong&gt;Interlingua&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sabir&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Occidental&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Romanal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Medial Europan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Lingua Franca Nova&lt;/strong&gt;. Also, just so one can get a flavour of these languages, I append the Pater Noster in each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back at some of my old Romance languages, I don't think I paid much attention to the Latin principle parts as a system. As the languages evolve out of Latin and into their more modern selves, the systematic nature might fall apart or accrete new forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/Kerno" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kerno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we can certainly see the survival of at least three principal parts for the regular verbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cantam, cantar, cantú&lt;/strong&gt; (sing)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;caru, carer, carú&lt;/strong&gt; (love)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;dormu, dormir, dormú&lt;/strong&gt; (sleep)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not until we meet up with those good old irregular verbs that more principal parts seem to linger:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Grammar, there is actually a section that lists the principal parts of the irregular verbs (though for some unknown reason, I didn't call them such):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;doc (or doy), dar, dedai, doú&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;istam, ystar, stetai, ystú&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;currem, currer, coscorrai (or cocorrai), cursú&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;llodu, lloder, llosès, llosú&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ioc, ir, fu, eú&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;sentu, sentir, senti, sentú&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, four principal parts surviving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a Phazeoir Nusteor que bias 'n y ceues;&lt;br&gt;
foreth noef il tew nom;&lt;br&gt;
gouenyes il tew camouils;&lt;br&gt;
foreth fès la teva gouoluntáts&lt;br&gt;
en lâ derra cuomo 'ny ceues;&lt;br&gt;
danos-el osdia le nusteor panèn cuotidièn;&lt;br&gt;
dimeti y nusteor dheuz&lt;br&gt;
cuomo dimitemus ai nusteor dheutoeres;&lt;br&gt;
et ne nus attrayer rhen al tentación,&lt;br&gt;
mays eliveránus des val.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/Lucarian" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loucarian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; takes its inspiration from Sabir and has a similarly reduced verbal conjugation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amare, amando, amato&lt;br&gt;
clevere, cleviendo, cleveto&lt;br&gt;
ajire, ajiendo, ajito&lt;br&gt;
pejeire, pejiendo, pejito&lt;br&gt;
vidure, videndo, viduto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a principal part of the ancestral Reman language, modern Loucarian takes the present/infinitive, progressive/continual &amp; past for its principal parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nemet sospeito pôdis IC cata maccareire; etti pejeto IC:&lt;br&gt;
enamverver tim maccareire coudeiere ican:&lt;br&gt;
jenì abba en samayam na&lt;br&gt;

mire doucere nasser adis peirasmom&lt;br&gt;
mire dê côire tim nasser ad injoudissiam.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/Interlingua_(IALA)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interlingua&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an invented Romance IAL. From the I-a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua_grammar#Verbs" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;grammar article&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; under Verbs, we can see exactly what has been done with Latin's principal parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All personal inflexion is stripped off, so there can be no "first principal part" as such. However, the Latin present stem remains largely intact, so the I-a present tense could continue to serve as first principal part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The infinitive remains distinct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old Latin perfect stems have all been obliterated; the I-a past tense is formed upon the Latin imperfect (present stem), so there can be no "third principal part".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Latin past participle remains in I-a.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could say the principal parts of an Interlingua verb are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;parla, parlar, parlate&lt;br&gt;
dice, dicer, dicíte&lt;br&gt;
senti, sentir, séntite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interlingua is not entirely regular as regards its verbal system. There are a few (unofficial) irregulars (thank Goodness!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal parts of esser are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;es, esser, era, essite&lt;/strong&gt; thus four principal parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nostre Patre, qui es in le celos,&lt;br&gt;
que tu nomine sia sanctificate;&lt;br&gt;
que tu regno veni;&lt;br&gt;
que tu voluntate sia facite&lt;br&gt;

como nos pardona a nostre debitores,&lt;br&gt;
e non duce nos in tentation,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/Lingua_Franca" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sabir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (also knows as Mediterranean Lingua Franca) was an actual, natural Romance IAL in use within the Mediterranean Sea basin from the middle ages onwards to about the mid 19th century or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is well known for severe reduction &amp; levelling of morphology in general. There are but two principal parts, both surviving from Latin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;parlar, parlato&lt;br&gt;
fazer, fazeto&lt;br&gt;
sabir, sabito&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present tense, imperative and infinitive are all wrapped within the immutable infinitive; the past and past participle are wrapped up within the old perfect participle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple odd forms. For example, in the Pater Noster we find &lt;em&gt;noi volir ki nomi di ti star &lt;strong&gt;saluti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of which I (having no grammar of the language available) can only imagine to be a past participle of saluer. Why the -i termination and why not "salueto", I don't know. Obviously Sabir was not &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to level all irregularity. It evolved naturally and over a long period of time within a broad geographical region. Oddities are bound to survive / arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Padri di noi, ki star in syelo,&lt;br&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;This has been called "Anglish", a type of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_writing" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;constrained writing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As compounding is a productive force in English (ie, it happens frequently and is not limited to an existing set of words), I wouldn't say that this should be considered relexification. A relexification would have a strict set of German style compounds to use, but something that is just constrained writing would allow you to generate alternate synonymous compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm in the early stages of creating an alien language for a personal writing project. I'm trying to avoid the aliens' language having properties that human languages do that are somehow linked to our anatomy. One of the most obvious examples of such a feature is a numerical system with base ten due to the number of digits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are language concepts that are linked to our anatomy in comparable ways that I should find alternatives for when creating a language for aliens who are not humanoid? Any references for links between our anatomy and such language concepts or features are much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Some obvious ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phonetics&lt;/strong&gt;, be it of spoken or signed language, is obviously constrained by the body of humans - both in the channels (aural, visual) employed and also in how they are employed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metaphors&lt;/strong&gt; often make use of body parts. Spatial prepositions and adverbs are often derived from relevant body parts: front from face, forehead, nose, chest; back from back or butt; up from head… you get the picture. Basically every organ has been referred to as being the cause of emotions etc as well in metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Words for &lt;strong&gt;directions&lt;/strong&gt; in particular are also somewhat based on human anatomy. We have lateral symmetry (left-right) but an alien could likely have some form of radial symmetry in their bodies, which would make the concepts of leftness and rightness very weird to them. Aquatic beings would also likely have a different concept of directions altogether, probably based more on the orientation of their own bodies than relative to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the things that come to mind. However, much more importantly, the inner workings of language as a whole would likely be different from a human’s. There are some things in human language that you really wouldn’t assume to be necessary. Just to make two examples: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty clear that humans take the raw audio input, break it into &lt;strong&gt;segments&lt;/strong&gt; (phones) then further abstract those phones into &lt;strong&gt;phonemes&lt;/strong&gt;, which are then in turn used to build more complex words. One could just as well imagine skipping the segmentation step and going directly from audio to meaning. There appears to be evidence however that some songbirds also employ what could be considered phonemes in their songs, so perhaps it is to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is in syntax: human language does not appear to allow circular dependencies, that is word¹ A modifying word B, which in turn modifies word A again. From my fairly limited understanding of syntax, human sentences can be structured in a tree structure. It seems plausible that an alien language might have more or less freedom, perhaps allowing cyclic graphs in their syntax… or in the other direction, only linear dependence. An example of an alien conlang playing around with this is &lt;a href="http://jbr.me.uk/euro/index.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Europan&lt;/a&gt;, which I personally consider one of the most interesting conlangs I’ve ever encountered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¹or clause&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvish_languages" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; explains that Tolkien modelled changes to his Elvish languages, something we'd call diachronic conlanging these days:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tolkien conceived a family tree of Elvish languages, all descending from a common ancestor called Primitive Quendian. He worked extensively on how the languages diverged from Primitive Quendian over time, in phonology and grammar, in imitation of the development of real language families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a summary of the major changes he modelled? For example, did he describe something akin to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Great Vowel Shift&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I would say yes.  If for example you own the copyright to a dictionary and a grammar guide for words that you made up, then people can only use those words within the "fair use" guidelines of copyright law.  So they could write an original poem using your language without your permission, but would need to provide citations to your copyrighted works.  But no one would be able to read or understand the poem unless they also had access to the copyrighted works, which would quickly stifle any use of the language.  If you want as many people as possible to learn and speak your language, then the fastest way to disseminate the language would be by releasing all materials into the public domain so that they are freely accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Moods are often intertwined with tense and aspect. In fact, the triad is commonly referred to in linguistics as tense-aspect-mood or just TAM. Aspect and tense are &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; straightforward, but how does mood relates to them exactly?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/a/330/128"&gt;(For tense and aspect in general, see this answer)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll summarize what Mark Rosenfelder says in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Language Construction&lt;/em&gt;, pp. 146-156 (some of which referring back to &lt;em&gt;Mood and Modality&lt;/em&gt;, F.R.Palmer 2001).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we start with &lt;strong&gt;modality&lt;/strong&gt;, which is concerned with the &lt;em&gt;status&lt;/em&gt; of the proposition, i.e. "how true it is, and whether it's subject to obligations and intentions". In contrast tense (at its most basic degree, ignoring semantic expansion) is interested to whether it happens before or after now, and aspect with overall temporal relation (hence the possibility of contrast between tenses within a given aspect).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosenfelder describes Palmer's classification of modals like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factual

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epistemic: speculative, assumptive &amp; deductive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evidential: reported, sensory &amp; deductive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deontic

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External: obligative, permissive, commissive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal: abilitive &amp; volitive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Most discussions bundle all of the "factual" branch as one "evidentials" category because languages with evidentials tend to have only one of the two sub-branches, which is also why deductive is listed twice without being self-contradictory)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically working from that, a &lt;strong&gt;mood&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;em&gt;what happen when modality bundles up with tense&lt;/em&gt;, and there it gets a little messy. Terminologically, Rosenfelder believes that indicative/subjunctive and realis/irrealis systems are separated more clearly by geography (specialists in given language families prefer one or the other) than grammatical reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, realis/indicative applies protoypically to real events, irrealis/subjunctive to "less real" stuff. What is included in each category may vary considerably (future events and imperative may categorize in either one, for example, depending on individual languages). Conditionals are irrealis in virtually all systems, but in Indo-European linguistics are traditionally treated as a third mood separate from both indicative and subjunctive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, moods are often more of a semantic division within the verbal paradigm owing to the lack of a separate marker for them (in most European languages I'm aware of, for example). When an explicit irrealis marker exists, it often takes over separate marking for tense and aspect, that is, there will be no overt marking of the subcategories like future vs. imperative (both only irrealis) or past vs. present (both realis). &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manam_language#Mood" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Manam&lt;/a&gt; is such a language (how unusual this is is unclear from Rosenfelder's writing).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The difference is that tense refers to the time an action (or state or phenomenon) happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was slim.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I am fat.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I will be fatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while aspect refers to the way an action (or state, or phenomenon) develops along time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I eat sushi. (habitual)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I am eating sushi. (continuous)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I used to eat sushi. (habitual)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I ate sushi. (perfect)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I was eating sushi. (continuous)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will have eaten sushi. (perfect)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I will be eating sushi. (continuous)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know if someone has a complete list of possible aspects, but here are some possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The action was/is/will be finished (perfect)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The action is/was/will be ongoing (continuous)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The action is/was/will be continually performed (habitual)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The action is/was/will be going to start (inceptive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The action is/was/will be intermitently performed (iterative)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the difference. Now comes the confusion - because that is what languages do, they confuse tense and aspect, in incoherent and incomplete systems that fail to either integrate or clearly separate those features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One first source of confusion is that many languages operate not only with the simple distinction between tenses as outlined above - past, present, future - but also with dependent and independent tenses. For instance, I may say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I used to eat sushi when Susan introduced me to Javanese food.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I am eating sushi while the president threats nuclear war against North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I will be eating sushi when they bring the wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in which one action is past, present or future regarding the time of the speech (Susan introduced me to Javanese food in the past, the president is threatening nuclear war in the present, they will bring wine in the future) while the other (me eating sushi) happens in the present - not the present regarding the time of speech, however, but the present regarding the other action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while this may be a source of confusion by itself, it expands to a further level of confusion because the interaction between dependent and independent action often has implications on the aspectuality of each of them. For instance, I say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I eat sushi. - or&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I am eating sushi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is understood that these are different aspects: in the first sentence, I am saying that I do habitually eat sushi, not that I have a dish of sushi in front of me. In the second sentence, however, I am saying that I am actually eating sushi in the moment I am talking, so the sentences are not synonim to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if I say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Go there and stop the president from doing bullshit while I eat sushi. - or&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Go there and stop the president from doing bullshit while I am eating sushi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the phrase "eat sushi" loses its habitual aspect, and turn into continuous, and the sentences are effectively synonimous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The there is the confusion that Sparksbet remarks, between "tense" as a grammatical form, and "tense" as a reference to actual time. As she says, "tenses" as grammatical forms are used to denote a mix of tense references and aspectual references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while the tense and aspectual references can be several, their grammaticalization, or lack thereof, is much more constrained. For instance, neither English, nor any other Western European language that I know has verb inflections for iterative or inceptive aspects. They instead use either syntactical devices, or morphological derivation - and those often vary weirdly from lexical item to lexical item. Let's take for instance Portuguese:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eu como sushi&lt;/em&gt; (habitual)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Estou comendo sushi&lt;/em&gt; (continuous)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Estou beliscando uns sushis&lt;/em&gt; (iterative) (where a different verb is used to make the aspectual reference)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eu bebo uísque&lt;/em&gt; (habitual)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Estou bebendo uísque&lt;/em&gt; (continuous)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Estou bebericando uísque&lt;/em&gt; (iterative) (where a morphological derivation of "beber" is used to make the aspectual reference)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, probably no natural language has a coherent tense-aspect system; the fact that some tenses seem to imply some aspects when put in relation to others probably means that, for reasons of economy, grammatical "tenses" will be used irregularly, given internal or even external context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could it be possible to build a conlang with a complete and coherent tense-aspect system? Perhaps, but I would say such coherence and completeness are only going to survive as long as the language is not effectively used by a human population.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;The difference is that tense refers to the time an action (or state or phenomenon) happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was slim.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I am fat.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I will be fatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while aspect refers to the way an action (or state, or phenomenon) develops along time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I eat sushi. (habitual)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I am eating sushi. (continuous)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I used to eat sushi. (habitual)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I ate sushi. (perfect)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I was eating sushi. (continuous)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will have eaten sushi. (perfect)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I will be eating sushi. (continuous)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know if someone has a complete list of possible aspects, but here are some possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The action was/is/will be finished (perfect)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The action is/was/will be ongoing (continuous)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The action is/was/will be continually performed (habitual)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The action is/was/will be going to start (inceptive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The action is/was/will be intermitently performed (iterative)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the difference. Now comes the confusion - because that is what languages do, they confuse tense and aspect, in incoherent and incomplete systems that fail to either integrate or clearly separate those features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One first source of confusion is that many languages operate not only with the simple distinction between tenses as outlined above - past, present, future - but also with dependent and independent tenses. For instance, I may say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I used to eat sushi when Susan introduced me to Javanese food.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I am eating sushi while the president threats nuclear war against North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I will be eating sushi when they bring the wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in which one action is past, present or future regarding the time of the speech (Susan introduced me to Javanese food in the past, the president is threatening nuclear war in the present, they will bring wine in the future) while the other (me eating sushi) happens in the present - not the present regarding the time of speech, however, but the present regarding the other action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while this may be a source of confusion by itself, it expands to a further level of confusion because the interaction between dependent and independent action often has implications on the aspectuality of each of them. For instance, I say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I eat sushi. - or&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I am eating sushi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is understood that these are different aspects: in the first sentence, I am saying that I do habitually eat sushi, not that I have a dish of sushi in front of me. In the second sentence, however, I am saying that I am actually eating sushi in the moment I am talking, so the sentences are not synonim to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if I say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Go there and stop the president from doing bullshit while I eat sushi. - or&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Go there and stop the president from doing bullshit while I am eating sushi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the phrase "eat sushi" loses its habitual aspect, and turn into continuous, and the sentences are effectively synonimous.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Estou beliscando uns sushis&lt;/em&gt; (iterative) (where a different verb is used to make the aspectual reference)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Imagine that I'm creating phonemic inventories for multiple conlangs, each of which is spoken by a people settled within (or roaming about) a very different physical environment from the others. Assuming that these different civilizations developed their languages completely apart from one another and haven't simply drifted apart from one original root language, is there any consensus that certain phonemes work better or worse in different environments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, do certain phonemes perform better or worse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;over choppy waters being sailed by a seafaring people?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through a jungle or heavily wooded area populated by a tree-dwelling people?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in a mountainous area frequently traversed by various groups settling near or even on the mountains?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;carrying over a vast inland plain or a placid lake?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cutting through the ambient noise of a swamp or jungle (or even a city)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just examples. I'm not specifically asking about any of those scenarios. I just want to make sure that any language I create would be as plausible as possible, down to the very last detail I can think of. Any reliable resources on the subject would be great, but as a complete novice, I haven't been entirely sure what to search for and have come up short on my attempts so far.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I don't know the exact changes Tolkien enacted, but here are a few in no particular order. You can tell they are quite inspired by real world sound changes in Celtic languages, which I'll mark in brackets. A good summary for quenya can be found &lt;a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/qevolution.rtf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aspirates /pʰ tʰ kʰ/ become fricatives /ɸ θ x/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of syncope, especially the second vowel in trisyllabic words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Quenya /kʷ/ is retained (Irish), while in Sindarin it becomes /p/ (Welsh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vowels are reduced or lost finally, especially in Sindarin (Welsh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sindarin features i-affection (Welsh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various forms of lenition (Irish, Welsh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plenty of assimilation in clusters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quenya features some palatalization with &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; /j/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syllabic consonants become non-syllabic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some sounds such as /ɣ/ and /ŋ/ are lost or merge with other sounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Quenya usually /w/ &gt; /v/, while in Sindarin initial /w/ &gt; /gw/ (Welsh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this answers your question somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There have definitely been serious linguistic theories about environment affecting features like this - the ones I can remember off the top of my head are that certain sound changes in Proto-Germanic were because its speakers had thicker phlegm or something and that tonogenesis is more likely to occur in certain tropical climates. The latter was a relatively recent paper. These are taken relatively seriously by many linguists, but most I've met are highly skeptical. They haven't reached widespread acceptance, so I would certainly not say there's any consensus about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, if you'd like your conlang to contain certain phonemes because you personally think they'd work better in a certain environment, there's nothing stopping you. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3680446/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;There has also been evidence&lt;/a&gt; that suggests that ejectives tend to occur more frequently in areas of higher elevation, perhaps due to their being easier to produce in these regions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We present evidence that the geographic context in which a language is spoken may directly impact its phonological form. We examined the geographic coordinates and elevations of 567 language locations represented in a worldwide phonetic database. Languages with phonemic ejective consonants were found to occur closer to inhabitable regions of high elevation, when contrasted to languages without this class of sounds. In addition, the mean and median elevations of the locations of languages with ejectives were found to be comparatively high. [...] we offer two plausible motivations for [this correlation's] existence. We suggest that &lt;strong&gt;ejective sounds might be facilitated at higher elevations due to the associated decrease in ambient air pressure, which reduces the physiological effort required for the compression of air in the pharyngeal cavity&lt;/strong&gt;–a unique articulatory component of ejective sounds. In addition, we hypothesize that &lt;strong&gt;ejective sounds may help to mitigate rates of water vapor loss through exhaled air&lt;/strong&gt;. [...] Our results reveal the direct influence of a geographic factor on the basic sound inventories of human languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a presentation on Wednesday at the Acoustical Society of America fall meeting, Maddieson showed that consonant-thick languages like Georgian are more likely to develop in open, temperate environments. Meanwhile, consonant-light languages like Hawaiian are more likely to be found in lush, hot ecologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete article even includes a world map showing consonant heaviness per region. Generally speaking there certainly seems to be a relation but the research is not very far into how exactly the impact of surroundings are on the languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Other researchers say this is just the beginning of a line of research into how nature rules our speech. "This is the first of its kind, and there are several others coming now. It's becoming increasingly clear that the way we speak is shaped by external forces," says Sean Roberts, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;OK, here are some details on classical Quenya and classical Sindarin (based on Helmut W. Pesch, Das große Elbisch-Buch, Bastei-Lübbe 2009)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phoneme inventory of Primitive Quendian was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;p   t   k
pʰ  tʰ  kʰ
b   d   g
m   n   ŋ
    r,l
        ɣ
w     j
a, e, i, o, u, ai, oi, ui, au, eu, iu
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early addition to this repertoire were prenasalised consonants &lt;code&gt;mb, nd, ŋg&lt;/code&gt; that developped differently in Quenya and Sindarin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound shifts for Quenya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pʰ   tʰ   kʰ  -&gt; f   θ   x  (later: θ -&gt; s)
b-   d-   g-  -&gt; v-  l-  Ø
-b-  -d-  -g- -&gt; -mb- -nd- -ŋg-
mb-  nd-  ŋg- -&gt; m-  n-  ŋ-   (later: ŋ- -&gt; n-)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loss of almost all b's, d's, and g's makes Quenya phonological similar to the Finnish language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quenya has some old compounds that preserve the pre-shifted state of a root, e.g., for &lt;em&gt;dome &gt; lome&lt;/em&gt; "night, darkness" there is an old compund &lt;em&gt;tindome&lt;/em&gt; and a newer regular one &lt;em&gt;Aldalome&lt;/em&gt;. This adds to the diachronical depth of the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound shifts for Sindarin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;p    t    k   -&gt; b   d   g
pʰ   tʰ   kʰ  -&gt; v   ð   ɣ (later: ɣ -&gt; Ø)
mb-  nd-  ŋg- -&gt; b-  d-  g- 
kʷ  -&gt; p
w-  -&gt; gw-
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sindarin also has a lot of lenitations (i.e., in certain contexts the initial consonsonant of a word is changed to some "softer" consonant) inspired by Welsh. The lenitations are different for original &lt;code&gt;b d g&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b d g&lt;/code&gt; that come from &lt;code&gt;mb  nd  ŋg&lt;/code&gt;. Sindarin also has acquired an umlaut &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT 3: &lt;strong&gt;Evolution of initial &lt;em&gt;sp-&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;st-&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;sk-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both in Sindarin and quenya, consonant clusters with an initial s were simplified in two steps: First, the stop became aspirated and the s was dropped&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; sp st sk -&gt; pʰ tʰ kʰ
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and than the aspirated stops became voiceless fricatives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; pʰ tʰ kʰ -&gt; f θ h
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Quenya, also the so-created &lt;em&gt;θ&lt;/em&gt;'s became &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; later, such that the net development of Quenya is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  st -&gt; s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT 1: Some more information gleened from the dictionary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quenya&lt;/strong&gt; Words beginning with &lt;code&gt;h-&lt;/code&gt; derive from Primitive Quendian roots beginning in &lt;code&gt;kʰ-&lt;/code&gt;. The initial consonant cluster &lt;code&gt;stʰ&lt;/code&gt; was simplified via &lt;code&gt;θ&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some words beginning with  &lt;code&gt;ç-&lt;/code&gt; like &lt;em&gt;hyarmen&lt;/em&gt; "south; left side" come from roots beginning in &lt;code&gt;kʰj&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sindarin&lt;/strong&gt;  has simplified some consonant clusters like &lt;code&gt;kl- kr-&lt;/code&gt; via intermediate voiceless l and r but in classical Sindarin those l's and r's are the usual voiced ones (despite being retained in orthography as &lt;em&gt;lh rh&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: The grammatical changes aren't explained in great detail. It seems that Tolkien applied some &lt;em&gt;handwavium&lt;/em&gt; here when he states that Quenya was consciously changed for greater clarity. On the other hand, Sindarin has evolved naturally (in Tolkiens internal history) in the woodlands of Middle Earth where everything is interwoven with everything.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;For a role-playing setting, I want to construct an elven language. The society of these elves strongly values being careful, thinking things through, taking one’s time and preventing mistakes. This is not a recent development but has been that way for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that the language should somehow reflect their culture of being careful and preventing mistakes — somewhat like the Japanese language mirrors the importance of showing respect to the other party with a wide range of respectful address suffixes, respectful grammatical features and a respectful vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what way could I implement my elves’ carefulness and mistake-preventing ideal in their language?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As requested in the comments, here is some further elaboration of what I have in mind.&lt;br&gt;
In cultures, certain behaviour is considered acceptable, certain behaviour is considered well-mannered and other behaviour is considered rude. For example, in Germany coming straight to the point is considered the normal, accepted behaviour while giving white lies is frowned upon to different degrees leading to Germans outright stating what they observe even in other languages in what is elsewhere considered an unfriendly manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand in China, not being able to provide an answer to a question is considered rude so accepted behaviour instead is to provide an answer even if one has no idea if it is true or not. (That is the impression I got from interaction with previous Chinese colleagues.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the culture of my elven society, it would be perfectly acceptable and even considered well-mannered to let a deadline pass or let somebody wait in order to perfection a good or a service. On the other hand, providing someone with a flawed product or a not fully thought-through piece of advice would considered disrespectful because one should have taken the time to ensure the error within does not exist. (Such behaviour would be entirely unacceptable in Germany where it is expected for the finished product to arrive five minutes before the deadline.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of common — to them — proverbs would underline this expectation. Maybe something along the lines of ‘the time you lose from a bad result outweighs the gain from finishing quickly’ or ‘even the king will gladly wait for his crown’ etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I have made the general idea more clear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Looking at the Tengwar script designed by Tolkien I feel a certain similarity to the unknown script of the Voynich manuscript: Many characters look very similar to others of the same script, and there is a restricted set of penstrokes used in the characters. Repetition of strokes is used to derive other characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am wondering whether the Tengwar script could be influenced by the script of the Voynich manuscript. Was Tolkien aware of the Voynich manuscript? Or, to the opposite, was Tengwar already designed before the Voynich manuscript was rediscovered and publically known?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Or, to the opposite, was Tengwar already designed before the Voynich manuscript was rediscovered and publically known?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manuscript was rediscovered in 1912. Tolkien, according to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_constructed_by_J._R._R._Tolkien" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, started developing Elvish in 1910 or 1911... &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the Voynich manuscript was rediscovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is at least one claim that he was &lt;em&gt;aware&lt;/em&gt; of it, though, although it would have to be after he had already started developing the languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a transcript of a message sent to &lt;a href="http://www.voynich.net/Arch/2002/11/msg00040.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the Voynich mailing list&lt;/a&gt;, sent November 13, 2002:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;br&gt;
  I have "lurked" on this list for a while and finally have a comment to offer, albeit a very insignificant one.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I wonder if the fact that Prof. JRR Tolkien apparently had an interest in (or at least knowledge of) the Voynich Ms has been discussed or indeed is of any interest at all?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The thing is, a nagging feeling that I had once seen the VMs many years ago - long before my recent interest was sparked by that piece in The New Scientist - is resolved. I now recall it - and though the persons concerned having died long since makes my little anecdote mere hearsay and in no way veridical, I thought I'd forward it. An old friend, a retired military man with an amateur interest in codes and cyphers, once showed me a couple of not entirely distinct b&amp;w copies of pages from a curious coded manuscript, which I now realise were a couple of folios of the VMs. I was not especially interested in them at the time, I think, but the reason that the incident made an impression was that he said that they had been given to him by Prof JRR Tolkien. At that time I had just discovered and was very much 'into' Tolkien so I was most envious of my friend's knowing him and pressed for details of the great man, though in the end I never achieved my longed-for personal introduction. So I now wonder if there might be any reference anywhere in the mass of Tolkien papers to our VMs, and is this of any possible slight significance? After all, JRRT knew a great deal about languages and artificial scripts of course and if he was interested enough to make and pass on copies to a friend, he might have devoted some time to the VMs himself. And the Voynichese script does have a Tolkien-ish look to it or vice versa: could it have influenced him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(this was found through a link from &lt;a href="http://ciphermysteries.com/2008/01/16/voynich-manuscript-in-existing-novels" rel="noreferrer"&gt;CipherMysteries.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since his development started before the Voynich manuscript was discovered, I'd say that it's... kinda &lt;em&gt;unlikely&lt;/em&gt; that he was inspired by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since his development started before the Voynich manuscript was discovered, I'd say that it's... kinda &lt;em&gt;unlikely&lt;/em&gt; that he was inspired by it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I know that a Euro-centric conlang is a conlang based mostly on Indo-European grammar, or more generally a conlang that is written from a worldview (conscious or not) that the &lt;em&gt;"normal"&lt;/em&gt; language is Indo-European, but what are the traits of a Euro-centric conlang? What are the things that are a dead giveaway that the language is Euro-centric? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be a grammatical curiosity specific to Indo-European, or maybe something like a conlang being based around one non-Indo-European language feature as a kind of "gimmick" (although these are just unfounded speculation, seeing as I don't know the answer).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The term "Standard Average European" (SAE) pretty much covers it, and has been around since the 1930s. Haspelmath listed a number of typical "Euroversals" in &lt;a href="http://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/seminar/abteilungen/sprachwissenschaft/ls_kortmann/Courses/Kortmann/Variation/index_html/2008-05-27.8724094854" rel="noreferrer"&gt;a portion of the 2001 book &lt;em&gt;Language Typology and Language Universals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These are listed in a more readable-to-laymen way in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Average_European" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the wikipedia article on the subject&lt;/a&gt;. Haspelmath included as true Europeanisms (that is, features that are part of the SAE &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprachbund" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Sprachbund&lt;/a&gt;) only features that fit the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the "core" European languages possess it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearby languages (Celtic, Turkic, etc.) lack it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eastern Indo-European languages (Armenian, Iranian, Indic languages, etc.) lack it -- this prevents us from merely calling it a feature of the Indo-European language family as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is not found in the majority of the world's languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Europeanisms identified by Haspelmath that fit this criteria include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definite and indefinite articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post-nominal relative clauses with resumptive relative pronouns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The (transitive) perfect formed with "have" plus a past participle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_relation" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Experiencers&lt;/a&gt; coded as nominative subjects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passive formed with a participle plus "to be"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A preference for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticausative_verb" rel="noreferrer"&gt;anticausatives&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causative" rel="noreferrer"&gt;causatives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inalienable_possession#External_possession" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Dative external possession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negation with negative pronouns and positive verb forms (e.g., "Nobody comes" instead of "Nobody won't come.")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://wals.info/chapter/121" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Particle comparatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relative-clause based equative constructions (e.g., "&lt;em&gt;tan&lt;/em&gt; Z &lt;em&gt;como&lt;/em&gt; X", "&lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; Z &lt;em&gt;wie&lt;/em&gt; X", "as Z as X")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject person marking used strictly for agreement (i.e., the verb is inflected for the person/number of the subject but the subject cannot be dropped)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different forms for reflexives vs. intensifiers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also identified several other features that were common among this Sprachbund but were not as well-documented as the above, such as the verb fronting of polar interrogatives (i.e., turning "I have done it" into "Have I done it?" to make a yes/no question), an inflectional marker for the comparative, and several others -- these are also included in the linked articles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In Toki pona, words are never inflected, and many words can act as a noun, verb or adjective in different contexts. The word "li" usually separates the subject from a predicate, and “e” goes before the object (in SVO order). With soweli (animal), moku (eat, food) and kili (fruit), one can say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;soweli li moku e kili&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The animal eats the fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the usage listed in the dictionary section of the official book, Toki Pona: the Language of Good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;li. PARTICLE (between any subject except &lt;em&gt;mi&lt;/em&gt; alone or &lt;em&gt;sina&lt;/em&gt; alone and its verb; also to introduce a new verb for the same subject)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is &lt;strong&gt;another&lt;/strong&gt; usage, as seen in phrase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;soweli li ijo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animals are things (&lt;em&gt;ijo&lt;/em&gt; means thing). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that this usage increases the ambiguity, because &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;soweli li moku&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can mean both ”The animal is eating” (with moku as an intransitive verb), or ”animals are food”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What role does the &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt; actually have in this phrase? &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Besides the traits of Standard Average European given in Sparksbet's answer, another defining feature is the phonology and basis of the lexicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eurocentric conlangs draw their phonology and their words heavily from well-known (and sometimes less well known) European languages. Depending on the preference of the authors, the words are based on Latin or modern Romance, English, Greek, or Slavonic languages. They also inherit a lot of European phonological quirks, e.g., in the selection of allowed consonant clusters both word-initially and inside words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feature that are absent or rare in European languages (like retroflex consonants, tone, initial use of /ŋ/) are absent from Eurocentric conlangs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;My idea on that would be very close to what you suggested yourself: introducing suffixes / prefixes which would indicate the uncertainty of the word.  For instance, let's suppose that your word for "strong" is &lt;code&gt;hariq&lt;/code&gt;, your word for "I sit down" is &lt;code&gt;brumo&lt;/code&gt; and your word for "house" is &lt;code&gt;niptug&lt;/code&gt;, and the word for "in" or "inside" would be &lt;code&gt;bomp&lt;/code&gt;.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I would invent some prefixes, such as &lt;code&gt;ar-&lt;/code&gt; meaning "with great certainty," no prefix meaning something along the lines of "a certain degree of certitude, but not absolute certainty," (such as, it is supposed that; it is presumed that) and &lt;code&gt;fun&lt;/code&gt;, meaning, "a large amount of uncertainty" (such as "we think" or "it appears possible that")**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let us suppose that I want to say that I that I sit down in the house, with an extreme certainty that it was a house that I was sitting in, but the fact that I was sitting or that I am actually inside is assumed to be true, though it could be theoretically disproved.  I would say,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;arniptug bomp brumo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this fictive language,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;funhariq niptug arbomp brumo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;would mean, "I sit down in a place definitely inside a house which appears to be strong."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that these suffixes / prefixes could theoretically be added to any part of speech, or made different for nouns, verbs, adjectives, interjections, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also possibly devise a way to make the order of the words show a carefulness about exactly how accurate what is being said is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;* Words invented totally randomly.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;** Again, randomly selected; more or less prefixes could be used,
 with different definitions.  This is just an example.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Expanding on Sparksbet's answer, additional features, from the conlanging point of view as listed by Mark Rosenfelder in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Language Construction&lt;/em&gt; (pp. 30-31), that tend to pile up on top of the SAE elements. While many of these are not particularly rare at all cross-linguistically, the overall combination (especially combined with actual SAE features), shines a brighter light on the "Europeanness" of a language:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;(italics are my additions)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A phonology that explores little beyond European languages &lt;em&gt;(usually German, French or Spanish with a few sounds swapped or added)&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "standard fantasy phonology" is English consonants + /x/ &lt;em&gt;and (usually) Spanish vowels. Rosenfelder notes in passing elsewhere that English's vowel system is unusual, and most budding conlangers seem aware of that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six distinct pronouns with gendered ones for third person only and usually with object forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nouns paradigm with only singular/plural forms, and possibly case &lt;em&gt;(usually 5-8)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjectives are either invariable or decline like nouns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verbs conjugating by person &lt;em&gt;(a single one, too)&lt;/em&gt; and number, with only three basic tenses (past/present/future) plus maybe a conditional &lt;em&gt;or irrealis/subjunctive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/342/how-does-mood-relate-to-tense-and-aspect"&gt;Modality&lt;/a&gt; involves auxiliary verbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SVO word order + nominative/accusative alignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions and negatives are formed with some sort of particles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number system is decimal and the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_kinship" rel="noreferrer"&gt;kinship system is eskimo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even SAE languages have significant non decimal elements: dozens and grosses in English, vigesimal elements in French, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4bmZ1gRqCc" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morotuncanian&lt;/strong&gt; has some verbal aspects that I rather doubt appear in natural languages of the primary world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sedative&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Excitative&lt;/em&gt; verbal aspects. The former aspect expresses the nature of the action, through time, as calming and steady in nature. The latter aspect expresses the nature of the action, through time, as unsteady or agitated in nature, but not to the point of being considered iterative or incessant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a &lt;a href="https://www.yog-sothoth.com/wiki/index.php/R%27lyehian#Vocabulary_List" rel="noreferrer"&gt;vocabulary list&lt;/a&gt; available, that gives us a decent taste of the words - for instance, &lt;em&gt;'ai&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;em&gt;speak&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;call&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this bear any resemblance to any natural languages? Do we know the inspiration for the words?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Ostensibly, the transcription we have of R'lyehian is supposed to be a crude attempt to represent utterly inhuman sounds with the Latin alphabet. Most of what I can find on R'leyhian claims that it attempts to be an un-Earthly language: it does not distinguish between parts of speech, for example. It seems likely to me that Lovecraft at least attempted to invent a fully &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; conlang here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Cthulhu-language" rel="noreferrer"&gt;a Quora answer&lt;/a&gt; claiming the language "has basic elements of Welsh and German glottals," but it's unclear what exactly that means and where they got that information from.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;After a bit of searching, the only remotely Greek-based altlang I've found is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Altlangs/comments/4yjksn/eressilian_a_neohittite_altlang/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Eressilian&lt;/a&gt;, which is mentioned only in the above Reddit post. It claims to be the result of the evolution of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittite_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Hittite language&lt;/a&gt;, after mixing with other languages in the region surrounding Asia Minor. These languages (notably Persian, Arabic, and Greek) mainly contributed loanwords, which were then modified and incorporated. Unfortunately, little information is given, and there's no substantial vocabulary list. The only supposedly "Greek" word given is &lt;em&gt;adelphotés&lt;/em&gt;, which - matching sentences word for word - seems to have been turned into &lt;em&gt;elelpulush&lt;/em&gt;. I haven't been able to determine its meaning or origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notes on Eressilian:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hittite language was an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_languages" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Anatolian language&lt;/a&gt;, which may or may not be "daughter languages" in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Indo-European family&lt;/a&gt;. A competing hypothesis is that it is instead a sister language family, developing separately, rather than a branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The modern Greek language is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_languages" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Hellenic language&lt;/a&gt;, definitely Indo-European; Persian is also Indo-European, an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Iranian_languages" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Indo-Iranian language&lt;/a&gt;. Arabic, on the other hand, is an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afroasiatic_languages" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Afroasiatic language&lt;/a&gt;, not Indo-European. This means that there any purely Hellenic influence will be reduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eressilian's notable loss of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;grammatical gender&lt;/a&gt; is likely a Persian influence, not Greek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Greek influence on Eressilian is largely only through loanwords, and is not shown in grammatical structures. It's there, but it's minor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Everything you make up is your intellectual property, but that does not mean you could decide who gets to use it and how. Programming languages are actually quite similar in this regard. We need to distinguish several concepts about a conlang:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dictionary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grammar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;texts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inventing and &lt;strong&gt;naming&lt;/strong&gt; the language, effectively means you are entitled to decide what counts as &lt;em&gt;$language&lt;/em&gt; and what does not. You probably could even register a trademark for it in some jurisdictions. You cannot stop people from extending the dictionary or deriving a dialect, but they could probably not legally call it &lt;em&gt;$language&lt;/em&gt; without your approval. They could still use a slightly different name even incorporating the original one, e.g. "&lt;em&gt;$dialect&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;$language&lt;/em&gt;", and you could do nothing about it. (For instance, &lt;em&gt;Commonmark&lt;/em&gt; initially &lt;a href="https://talk.commonmark.org/t/standard-markdown-is-now-commonmark/434" rel="noreferrer"&gt;was called &lt;em&gt;Standard Markdown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and was renamed after protests from the author of &lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt; and coiner of that term, but this happened out of courtesy not out of legal obligations, and variants with names like &lt;em&gt;Github Flavored Markdown&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Markdown Extra&lt;/em&gt; remain unaffected.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;dictionary&lt;/strong&gt; most likely is subject to database laws which differ significantly between jurisdictions and can be rather strange. I remember a case where it was legal to read, manually type and publish a copy of a printed phone register, but the redistribution of a computer scan was prohibited. It's best to treat the word list as public domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;grammar&lt;/strong&gt; is much like an algorithm in mathematics. That means it usually cannot be patented or otherwise protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texts&lt;/strong&gt; in or about the language are of course still copyrighted intellectual property of their authors. The inventor or maintainer of the language has no say in this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Let's suppose that you want to create Conlang B. You want this conlang to be derived from Conlang A. Let's also suppose that you have some arbitrary period of time in between A and B. Are there any rules of thumb for how many steps&amp;mdash;how many major grammar/vocabulary alterations, etc.&amp;mdash;would generally manifest between A and B as a general guideline? Is it entirely up to the conlanger's prerogative, or can patterns from natural languages be found?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The canon of classical languages studied in Europe comprises Latin, Greek, and Hebrew (and maybe classical Aramaic).

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I think the question is not well formulated. Mostly because "language concepts" (e.g. tense-aspect-mood systems, animacy, verbal valence, case systems...) reflect the workings of the &lt;em&gt;human mind&lt;/em&gt; far, far more than they could ever reflect the human anatomy. Anatomy/biology of course influences massive swathes of &lt;em&gt;semantics&lt;/em&gt;, but I don't think anything other than pure phonetics or sign language is influenced by anatomy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facial expressions and body language probably belong there, but tend to have a huge cultural element. Position of the ears, for example, is not something humans make (or can make) use of, but &lt;a href="http://hornedfreak.tumblr.com/post/171381092902/elf-ear-communication-headcannon" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;maybe elves could&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more semantics example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We make distinctions useful to us &lt;em&gt;at our given size&lt;/em&gt;. We cannot tell apart things by smell, or by UV light the way other animals (or measuring instruments) can. We do not tell apart very tiny things by basic names (e.g. ants, mites, sand). If we could sense, say, gravitic variations or psychic energies, we might have entirely different ways to describe position or time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time is linear to us&lt;/em&gt;, cause precedes effects and so on, we cannot watch again a past event. This obviously affects how language models time and mood. Consider the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9xShALLHAU" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Observers from Fringe&lt;/a&gt; or any other species with a different perception of time. Their possibly utterly alien perception of time may well be the reason their writing is (apparently) indecipherable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Fish" is not a proper biological class (and whether marine mammals are excluded from it in common parlance is debatable!) because we don't feel a need to be any more precise about it, but we would have better concepts for it &lt;em&gt;if we were a marine species&lt;/em&gt;! Similarly, plants are divided, roughly, into, flowers, lianas, grass, trees and shrubs. This system is not even very efficient for Earth ecology!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expanding on the UV thing, &lt;em&gt;color words are constrained by our visual capacity&lt;/em&gt;, and typically distinguish a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;surprisingly limited number of basics&lt;/a&gt;. Forget the hierarchy part, nonderived terms usually stop around 6-8 words, why? A species with different color perception would do things differently. Mark Rosenfelder spends an entire &lt;em&gt;chapter&lt;/em&gt; on this point in his &lt;em&gt;Conlanger's Lexipedia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as &lt;em&gt;number base systems&lt;/em&gt;, decimal and vigesimal are most common in humans because we have 10 fingers, and 20 fingers and toes. (although a huge number of bases have been documented, I don't think any languages have a binary or ternary one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship_terminology" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kinship terminology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is based off our own reproductive biology (and our gregariousness). What of a species where the embryo must be incubated in a member of a different species? What about a species where reproduction requires gametes from more than two individuals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Mapping word class jargon from one language to another is a dicy project. Lojbanists decided that they needed to invent entirely new words for word class jargon. That said...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the toki pona particles (o, li, e, pi, la) act most similar to Japanese particles or English clitics, eg. "the". Clitics bind to a phrase. There are other &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitic" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;tests for what counts as a clitic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are semantically bleached, do not act like &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; words. "li" in particular introduces a noun phrase or a verb phrase. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Yes, but when this happens, you have to consider two possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is really a content word followed by many, many modifiers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A particle has been omitted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the toki pona parse I wrote, I have an arbitrary cut off of something like 5 modifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;telo kala seli jelo waso wawa kulupu soweli jan li suli.
The beasty, familial, powerful, bird-like, yellow, hot, fish water is big.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(that doesn't really mean anything, it just makes the parser blow up)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tokipona.net/parser/L?i=C" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://tokipona.net/parser/L?i=C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the corpus of public texts, heads followed by 4 or more modifiers almost never legitimately happen, unless someone forgot a necessary particle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, they are valid, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mi jo e soweli lili lili lili lili lili lili lili lili lili lili lili lili.
I have a small...small animal.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;Yes, but when this happens, you have to consider two possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is really a content word followed by many, many modifiers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A particle has been omitted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the toki pona parse I wrote, I have an arbitrary cut off of something like 5 modifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;telo kala seli jelo waso wawa kulupu soweli jan li suli.
The beasty, familial, powerful, bird-like, yellow, hot, fish water is big.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(that doesn't really mean anything, it just makes the parser blow up)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tokipona.net/parser/L?i=C" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://tokipona.net/parser/L?i=C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Altlangs/comments/4yjksn/eressilian_a_neohittite_altlang/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Eressilian&lt;/a&gt; (Hittite)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote the answer you linked, which talks about Eressilian, a conlang based on the Hittite language, supplemented with loanwords from Arabic, ancient Greek and Persian. I talked there about the Greek influence (which is slight, from the information we have); the Hittite roots are of course much stronger. An example passage given by the creator shows Article 1 of the &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;, in Hittite and Eressilian:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Hittite&lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Hūmant+es antuhsa+es arawa+iya+ya annual+iya kraht(Persian)+a hoquq(Persian/Arabic) anda asanzi hassant+ke. Anda mem+iyan+a wajidan(Persian) asanzi har+ke+ya  ēsdu aniya+du adelphotés(Greek)+us katta hūmant+as anda.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h3&gt;Eressilian&lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Uvẽndesh ãndushesh irawedhadha ãnnuelidha krata ukuk ãnda eshẽnji eshshẽndke. Ãnda mẽvedheva wajidan eshẽnji erkedha ishchu enidhadhu elelpulush kata uvẽndesh ãnda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have a grasp on the pronunciation of either language, but after attempting to sound it out, the two are quite similar. For instance, the Hittite "antuhsa es" appears similar to the Eressilian "ãndushesh" - both meaning, I believe, "man" or "human".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa%27uld#Language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Goa'uld&lt;/a&gt; (Egyptian) (sort of)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the "language" spoken by the Goa'uld race in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's ostensibly based in ancient Egyptian, drawing from the language and hieroglyphs - appropriate, given that the Goa'uld supposedly ruled Earth as gods, sometimes appearing as the gods of the ancient Egyptians. I keep seeing references to a writing variation called Nakht, which I can't find much information on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some (though not much) of the writing uses the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meroitic_alphabet" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Meroitic system&lt;/a&gt;. To my (untrained) eye, there don't appear to be a huge amount of similarities (see &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Meroitic.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Meroitic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Goa%27uld_alphabet.GIF" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Goa'uld&lt;/a&gt;), but some crossovers show through pretty easily, such as "l"s and "n"s. Those are probably the main Meroitic contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said . . . &lt;a href="https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/41162/41082"&gt;Goa'uld vocabulary is basically made up&lt;/a&gt;, and so it's not really a conlang. No attempts were made to keep much linguistic continuity, and so it's not a constructed language as such. There are probably &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; similarities to ancient Egyptian, but likely not many. I include it here only because its use of some ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs is notable; it appears that an alphabet for the language was indeed constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://forum.unilang.org/viewtopic.php?t=43643" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Irǧeret&lt;/a&gt; (Egyptian and Akkadian, with Ugaritic, Arabic and Hebrew influences)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one seems decently documented by its author. The vocabulary and phonology are derived from Egyptian, although there isn't much vocabulary listed. The organization of nouns - in number and gender - resembles Akkadian. It also contains the Akkadian declensions, with the addition of the dative. In short, the grammar and morphology appears Akkadian, while the vocabulary should be Egyptian. It's an interesting blend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A note on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Proto-Indo-European&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of languages have been derived from Proto-Indo-European, the reconstructed common ancestor of Indo-European languages. It's only known indirectly. Therefore, many (though not all) conlangs that are based on it also use words from more recent Indo-European languages. Proto-Indo-European is certainly antique; whether it's "lesser-known" is perhaps another question entirely. That said, it's not a terribly common template, and so I'm listing some Proto-Indo-European languages here for the sake of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://sambahsa.pbworks.com/w/page/10183084/FrontPage%7CThe" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sambahsa&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambahsa" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sambahsa&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;international auxiliary language&lt;/a&gt;, appears to be heavily influenced by Proto-Indo-European, primarily through vocabulary. It modifies words from languages ranging from India to Spain, attempting to go back to the languages' common roots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140323053118/http://www.freewebs.com/keran_shadlag/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Atlantean&lt;/a&gt; (Proto-Indo-European):&lt;/strong&gt; Like Sambahsa, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantean_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Atlantean&lt;/a&gt; is Proto-Indo-European in origin, especially when it comes to vocabulary (grammatically, it is quite different). Notably, it was created by Marc Okrand, the man behind Klingon. According to the linked website, Okrand

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;took Proto-Indo-European roots and then compared them with language families at various points in time from around the world.  Where similarities between words existed, he altered the root or its semantic value to reflect that similarity.  By the combination of the PIE roots and by the adoption of new roots from these world languages, he created a vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that these languages borrow vocabulary from many descendants of Proto-Indo-European, you could argue that they're not directly based in it. However, the intentional linguistic diversity within the family - and the attempts to base words on common similarities that are attributable to Proto-Indo-European - do seem to make these conlangs its descendants.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Culture shows up in languages by a few routes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialized jargon&lt;/strong&gt;. They might have a lot of specialized words for "carefulness". Láadan is just a bunch of specialized jargon, imho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metaphysical obsessions&lt;/strong&gt;. In most languages, we have to care about these issues like when it happened and the gender of the speakers and we have to care about it in every sentence, even if it isn't otherwise topical. In English, you have to choose a gender or animacy status for a pronoun even if the distinction is irrelevant. Japanese making honorific/politeness markers obligatory is a perfect example. If I ever get around to writing a language, I plan to use this strategy, although, it only works with features that everything has. For example, if I make "edibility" a necessary grammatical marker, I may have to waste a lot of air on "inedible" and "doesn't apply".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sapir-Whorf&lt;/strong&gt;. This is all pseudo-science bunk anyhow, so you just assert that this or that feature, say through sympathetic magic makes your speakers this way or that way. German words fit together like a car engine and that is why they make such great cars. You have to form these sentences very carefully, so the people who speak the language must be very careful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the mechanics—these show up as prefixes/affixes to nouns, adjective etc, or lexical distinctions, or a lack of lexical gaps. For example, just having a short simple word instead of needing a paragraph to discuss varieties of "carefulness"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corpus&lt;/strong&gt;. A language shows its culture in the corpus of text. If the language has lots of sample text that says, "gosh, we are very careful people," then that is good enough. But anything can be said in any language, so such a language wouldn't be, by corpus, any more "careful" or suited to talk about the "careful life" than any other language.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;Culture shows up in languages by a few routes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialized jargon&lt;/strong&gt;. They might have a lot of specialized words for "carefulness". Láadan is just a bunch of specialized jargon, imho.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Ignoring that fluency means a wide range of things (reading, writing, conversing, conversing at a college educated level, etc)--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really rare. Outside of Esperanto, which as L1 speakers, the number of people who get to the lower levels of fluency is in the low two digits. Klingon, Na'vi, toki pona have up to tens of people who have various levels of fluency. Getting solid data is also really hard, the numbers you see in wikipedia are often wild ass guesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a thought experiment, you can look at how many languages are even potentially speakable, ie. is the specification complete to say most or all possible sentences? Is there a community? Before the internet, this was usually an insurmountable problem, finding anyone who'd want to learn your language. Are there any "poison pills" in the language put there by the designer specifically to discourage humans from trying to use it? (Pedophilia in the conculture and absurdly difficult pronunciations come to mind)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Henry did a study of this, targeting more recent personal conlangs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Vocabulary Changes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New words&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vocabulary can be expected to contain a few new terms or simpler ways of describing certain things that might be seen a lot or might be new, such as new star systems, stellar formations, etc. The words for some of these terms might already exist but shorter terms and compound nouns might come into play to make everyday speech in the Generation Ship a bit simpler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lost words&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to new terms being added to the vocabulary, some terms may go out of use and become lost from the vocabulary; for example, certain things that might only be seen on a planet (like a tree for example, or a mountain). Terms for those might be lost because they would likely not be used very often if at all. Once the ship arrives and these concepts are explored again, new terms might develop, though they might be similar if the terms are created based on modifying and combining existing terms (tree might be "tall bush" and mountain might be "giant mound", for example).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'll assume here that the generation ship in question's mission is a resounding success: the inhabitants were not attacked by huge insectile aliens that enslaved them all; the Computer did not rise up and shut out its erstwhile masters, leaving them to fend as best they could in a decaying piece of technology. No, society not only survived but thrived and the people who set foot on their new homeworld have at their command all the accumulated knowledge and technology they brought with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, there will, I think, actually be very little change in the language spoken on board the generation ship. Whatever interlanguage the first generation brings aboard (likely English) will be the language of general communication among all the inhabitants of the ship. Education will be carried out in English, though programmes will be in place to teach "ancestral" languages brought on board as well. And of course, the homes of firstgen folks will resound with their own native languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As subsequent generations are educated (in English), familiarity with other languages will fade. Since this project, while still Earthbound, brought together the best and brightest and well educated to begin with, their level of comfort with English will be high regardless of their cradle tongues. Because running a generation ship requires a huge commitment in education (sciences, mathematics) &amp; experience (astrogation, complex technological subsystems), communications skills will be highly prized. Just as with Modern Standard American, the nature of life &amp; culture aboard ship will tend to keep a fairly strict standard language in place. We're basically looking at a situation where everyone is highly literate and most likely cross-trained in several disciplines ánd certainly likely trained in one or more "traditional" crafts, artforms or skillsets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that jargon won't arise or that English will all of a sudden stop borrowing words from other languages! Far from it. By the time we get to journey's end, I'd speculate that &lt;em&gt;lastgens&lt;/em&gt; will be quite able to understand the recorded speech and song of &lt;em&gt;firstgens&lt;/em&gt; and that their languages will be not much different at all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The idea that language would not change over 1000 years of travel in space is absolutely ludicrous. 1000 years ago was before &lt;em&gt;Middle English&lt;/em&gt; existed. Massive amounts of language change can occur over such a long period of time. Even very conservative languages change significantly over such a long period of time. No language will remain unchanged after 1000 years. Based on natlangs, it's more likely than not that the language will not be mutually intelligible with its predecessor after 1000 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How exactly the language changes depends a lot on the details of the situation -- how multicultural is the ship? What is the lingua franca of the ship? How are other languages viewed relative to the lingua franca? If there is enough of a divide in where different languages are used (such as if everything for official purposes is in English but a great number of native, say, Spanish speakers speak Spanish with their families at home), you may end up with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diglossia" rel="noreferrer"&gt;diglossia&lt;/a&gt; arising. If there are significant numbers of multilingual people on these ships, you can bet there will be a lot of borrowing from minority languages into the dominant language, at least in less formal contexts. As in real life, there may be stigma against using such borrowings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, language change in this situation won't likely differ that much from language change anywhere else. A conlanger has a lot of freedom in how they want to deal with the diachronics in this situation. The only real difference is that you don't have any chance of outsiders suddenly arriving and bringing with them waves of loanwords. ...Well, at least, you &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PardonMyKlingon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; don't.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;More or less, the generation ship language will be a natural evolution of the languages brought in by the first generation (their common language probably being something similar to L2 English).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things will be spacy: They need a new system of orientation in 3D space with lack of gravity or artificial gravity at work, directions like up, down, east, north, west, and south are no longer meaningful. They will also develop some slang with respect to parts of their space ship and forget all the vocabulary about geographical features on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: The space ship is probably operating with an air pressure that is significantly lower than on earth, corresponding to an altitude of 1000 or 2000 m. In this case, the space ship language may acquire &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejective_consonant" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ejective consonants&lt;/a&gt; (For a correlation between altitude and ejective consonants, see Caleb Everett's work "Evidence for Direct Geographic Influences on Linguistic Sounds: The Case of Ejectives" &lt;a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065275" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065275&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;My guesses would be that it evolves towards one of two extremes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;less morphology, fixed word order - this is what happened to English. Dropping cases and most inflections, but having a stricter word order to compensate for the loss of morphological markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;more morphology, freer word order - not sure if that actually is realistic. It's harder to invent new inflections than to drop them, and unless there is a flourishing poetry scene (perhaps to battle boredom), there wouldn't be too much reason for making word order less strict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most languages seem to navigate a path between those extremes, but that would mean it'd just become a different language altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at some real-life examples is tricky, as Latin -&gt; French/Spanish/... for example had lots of interference from other languages and external events. In general I would think the language becomes simpler. It's a closed community, so changes can spread quickly and are not a hindrance to understanding. The environment is fairly static, so you don't need complicated phrases to refer to things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One aspect would be communicating with the ship's computer (assuming a natural language interface) or texts. But you could think that a 'priest' class develops which does that communication and preserves the 'old' language. A bit like the Vatican with Latin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word meanings would probably change, as there are many words but only a limited number of things that need to be named; words would probably be re-used, or acquire new additional meanings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things that won't change are the underlying distributional laws of language. There will still be a number of high-frequency short words that make up most of the active vocabulary. Zipf's law will still apply. The relationship between phoneme inventory and average word length will also remain: fewer phonemes will result in longer words. Short words will be more polysemous than long ones. But overall language will adapt to it's purpose, communication, in the given environment. If there are no trees, then the word &lt;em&gt;tree&lt;/em&gt; might suddenly refer to an antenna. Or &lt;em&gt;grass&lt;/em&gt; might be used to mean "an area of metal flooring that is slippery when wet".&lt;/p&gt;

In general I would think the language becomes simpler. It's a closed community, so changes can spread quickly and are not a hindrance to understanding. The environment is fairly static, so you don't need complicated phrases to refer to things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One aspect would be communicating with the ship's computer (assuming a natural language interface) or texts. But you could think that a 'priest' class develops which does that communication and preserves the 'old' language. A bit like the Vatican with Latin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word meanings would probably change, as there are many words but only a limited number of things that need to be named; words would probably be re-used, or acquire new additional meanings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things that won't change are the underlying distributional laws of language. There will still be a number of high-frequency short words that make up most of the active vocabulary. Zipf's law will still apply. The relationship between phoneme inventory and average word length will also remain: fewer phonemes will result in longer words. Short words will be more polysemous than long ones. But overall language will adapt to it's purpose, communication, in the given environment. If there are no trees, then the word &lt;em&gt;tree&lt;/em&gt; might suddenly refer to an antenna. Or &lt;em&gt;grass&lt;/em&gt; might be used to mean "an area of metal flooring that is slippery when wet".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There's not much info about it online at the moment, but I have been developing &lt;a href="http://pentalithia.ca/blog/djinnish-phono-ortho" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Emezila&lt;/a&gt;, a conlang based on a mixture of Sumerian and Arabic. It can't really be described as an evolution of Sumerian, but it draws a lot from Sumerian vocabulary and a little from Sumerian grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that widespread literacy, availability of written materials and public education are capable of &lt;em&gt;greatly&lt;/em&gt; slowing down rates of change in the standard language. Additionally, if the generation ship's inside are designed with an ecology (as some SF ships are, like Bernard Werber's &lt;em&gt;Le Papillon des étoiles&lt;/em&gt; or Léo's &lt;em&gt;Centaurus&lt;/em&gt;), you can't reasonably expect a shrinking of vocabulary about nature. Basically, in a 1000 years I'd expect changes, of course, but I'm not sure we have the comparison levels to characterize just how much chances are likely to actually occur because the rates of change of standard languages over such long periods of time (presuming no "dark age" occurs somewhere along the line) are currently simply not really known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case in point: literary French and English from 300  years ago are still pretty comprehensible today (Voltaire's first play was presented that year, Dafoe' &lt;em&gt;Robinson Crusoe&lt;/em&gt; is from 1719...). Go to three hundred years before &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; and you're firmly in Middle French/English, which are definitely rather different beasts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Others have mentioned that vocabulary for things not seen in space might vanish, and @HyperNeutrino mentioned that new terms might arise if the ship reaches a planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New terms might come into existence as metaphorical references to things that the colonists were familiar with on the ship. Just like we refer to "folders" and "files" on a computer or speak about "surfing" the "net" (using older terms to metaphorically refer to newer things that needed terms), generation ship colonists newly landed on a planet might refer to a land vehicle as a "shuttlecraft" or "capsule", call their political leader a "captain", or refer to the death penalty as "being thrown out of an airlock" (even if the actual means of execution becomes something else). Today we sometimes refer to uploading files as "posting" them. Our colonists might rediscover physical message boards but refer to posting notes on them as "uploading".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be a wider cultural effect too that expands to include both linguistic and non-linguistic features. If colonists are used to a shipboard timekeeping system that is detached from astronomical phenomena, or that is based on astronomical phenomena only visible from elsewhere in the universe, they might continue using it after landing on a planet despite the presence of astronomical phenomena that could be used to construct a calendar. Consider how the Apollo astronauts on the Moon continued to use Earth-based timekeeping metrics even though they could have adopted some sort of "Moon time" based on the cycle of the Lunar day and/or the apparent rotation of Earth in the sky. This sort of phenomenon could cause holidays to "rotate" throughout the seasons of the new homeworld in a similar way that dates defined in Earth-based lunar calendars (e.g. Ramadan) can occur in any solar season. Perhaps the new colony world has a year that is half that of Earth, so Christmas now comes every &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; northern hemisphere winter, or the year is twice as long as Earth's, so the colonists celebrate Christmas at the beginning of winter and again at the beginning of summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See Robert Heinlein's &lt;em&gt;Orphans of the Sky&lt;/em&gt; for some examples of how this might look.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;For the sake of concreteness, let's say my low-tech conculture is living in a few villages on a smallish island in the middle of the ocean (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcairn_Islands" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Pitcairn Islands&lt;/a&gt; comes to mind). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, this would mean that no adult ever has to learn their language, and that everyone knows everyone else to some extent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can one make predictions as to how the language would more likely look? Such as: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would it have a "large" phoneme inventory? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would it tend to be heavily inflected or analytical? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would there be a large number of irregular inflections? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would there be a well-developed system of expressing consanguinity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, would the size of the settlement(s) matter much? The difference between a single village or a dozen in regular contact, say. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As there is no one simple rule of thumb (or generally applicable rule at all), over history these have been messed up. If it would be practically doable, many linguists would want to rename those periods (but many intermediate forms would be lost because of undecided diachronics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Languages never written (fully reconstructed) usually span a long period of time (PIE spans 2000 years from 4500BCE to 2500BCE). If you'd follow the rule of "many sound changes", we'd be able to split PIE into 10 or more language segments because of sporadic sound changes everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually before a big separation of languages. Proto-Germanic separated into many languages quite fast (for a hypothetical one, at least). Middle Dutch was a nontrivial influence to both English and French, including my favourite words: &lt;em&gt;bodge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;feague&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our sample of the PIE western world, we see a recurring theme: PIE &gt; sub &gt; old &gt; middle &gt; modern. English, Dutch, German fit this perfectly, and with some fiddling (Counting Latin and proto-Italic as one sub, for no other proto-Italic still exists and Latin was quite early (Proto-Germanic even hypothetically borrowed some words)) the Romance languages. This theme can be also applied to Russian, with some bashing and bodging even the Chinese languages, if I recall correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big spelling changes, not by a regulation's suggestions (or laws&amp;mdash;think France) but by linguistic fashion changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a language sees itself as 'newer' and 'better' than its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just to fit. Calling Old and Middle English 'Old English' collectively would be 'weird' as too many changes have occurred for it to be one language. So they drew a line where they thought it would be applicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think it can be reduced to one single rule of thumb, like in jknappen's answer. Som&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt; sound chang&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;s affect many words, but don't split the languag&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;. For example: when &lt;strong&gt;-e&lt;/strong&gt;'s at the end of words becam&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt; silent, many words chang&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;d pronunciation (many underus&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;d words hav&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt; an &lt;strong&gt;-e&lt;/strong&gt;, which ar&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt; less common but mor&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt; numerous). Such 'common exceptions' make it difficult to have one single rule.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of hypotheses and conjectures floating around the linguistic community regarding typological features (like phoneme inventories, inflecting or isolating type etc.) and size of the speech community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, almost none of these conjectures is currently backed up by real world data (and, on the other side, real world data are often unavailable to evaluate such conjectures). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The linguist David Nettle argues that &lt;a href="https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/20971/language-change-over-distance/20975#20975"&gt;language evolution is faster in small speech communities&lt;/a&gt;, but this is also not a generally accepted point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last, but not least: &lt;em&gt;Never underestimate the influence of diachronics&lt;/em&gt;. Many linguistic features correlate very well with either the language family or with arealic features. So the starting language will have a long time influence on the language of the isolated group.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Derek Bickerton and John McWhorter both have studied pidgins and creoles. A general observation is that communities that have to deal with other communities who don't speak their language, but still have to communicate resort to using pidgins, creoles which are simplified, grammatically speaking. McWhorter says English lost it's complex grammar when Vikings arrived and couldn't deal with the complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, island communities that don't have to deal with other people can tolerate arbitrarily complex grammar since children have a spectacular skill for acquiring their first language as compared to adults. So as an isolated language accumulates difficulties, there is no pressure to make them go away, they just get added to the pile of obligatory complexities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature of Island speakers in specific is they are more likely to use a "towards the shore/away from the shore" as a grammatical marker, ref "&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/08/26/geocentric_direction_systems_use_uphill_uptown_instead_of_north_south_found.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;When "North" Isn't Actually North: Geocentric Direction Systems&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: 
Large phoneme inventory. Chinese, a lingua franca has a small inventory and a small inventory of syllables. Rotokas has a small phonetic inventory. Someone would have to graph this to see if there is a weak relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflections (really, any morphology), irregular forms (lexicalizations), culture-specific complexities-- I'd predict more of all of these for an isolated language. Proving it to satisfy skeptics would take a few academic papers. English's "2nd cousin twice removed" system, is complicated, but English is a lingua franca. Hard to say beyond generalities.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;Derek Bickerton and John McWhorter both have studied pidgins and creoles. A general observation is that communities that have to deal with other communities who don't speak their language, but still have to communicate resort to using pidgins, creoles which are simplified, grammatically speaking. McWhorter says English lost it's complex grammar when Vikings arrived and couldn't deal with the complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The particular circumstances on a generarion ship will work in several directions. Some accelerate language change, some slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accelerating: Language is used to create identity. The first, most important and biggest tribe are the ship's crew and passengers (if such a distinction is made). They will start to set themselves apart through names for themselves versus the planet dwellers.&lt;br&gt;Within the ship, different sub-tribes like engineers, gardeners, educators etc. will create respectively continue to develop their own slang in order to set themselves apart from other groups. The urge to set themselves apart is greater because the ship packs many people in a comparatively small space, creating a need to draw virtual borders. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accelerating: Groups with lots of spare time (which I suppose our space travelers will have) generally devote some of it to developing sophisticated tastes, fads and fashions, thus creating in-groups; their language evolution is interacting with these identity functions. Individuals who are unable or unwilling to speak "their slang" (and wear their hair cut, and posture ...) are marked as "not belonging to them". To a degree this happens in every generation of teenagers. But we can see that also on a larger scale in the development of the aristocratic French, or the fast-paced development of the politically correct speech in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowing down: There will be constant communication between all individuals of the ship through some kind of publications and messaging as well as personal conversation, given the necessary physical proximity and the need to cooperate during the mission (no group will be able to isolate themselves). This will ensure that there will continue to be a single &lt;em&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt;, fads and fashions not withstanding. Some people may learn and teach other languages for scientific, identity, hobby and nostalgic reasons, but they all will be competent in the main language. An important driver of the evolution of this language will be the slang of the youngsters, as always.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowing down: The generation ship will probably communicate via radio with the planet they came from; but most communication will be internal, partly because after a while communication with the home planet will not be real-time any more. The generation ship will form an isolated, small community. Such communities, like the Amish in America or the German settlers in Romania, are known to preserve customs and language longer than the bigger communities thy split off of. We can assume that the ship receives entertainment from the home planet, like music, movies and written prose. Thus they will keep in touch with the language on the home planet; whether that ongoing contact is sufficient to keep the language on board from running its own course I don't know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I remember reading somewhere of a creole-ish artificial language of two (possibly more) natural languages. In the text (I do NOT remember where it was) only one creole (I'm using the term loosely here, without regards to native speakers) was mentioned, without any usage/examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any examples of constructed languages that are specifically designed to be creoles (again, with a very loose usage of the term creole here) of natural languages? &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Esperanto was once used in the US army to realistically simulate the language situation when training.
Has any nation ever employed other constructed languages in the military as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_talker" rel="noreferrer"&gt;code talkers&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_talker" rel="noreferrer"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Code talkers are people in the 20th century who used obscure languages as a means of secret communication during wartime. The term is now usually associated with the United States service members during the world wars who used their knowledge of Native American languages as a basis to transmit coded messages. In particular, there were approximately 400–500 Native Americans in the United States Marine Corps whose primary job was the transmission of secret tactical messages. Code talkers transmitted these messages over military telephone or radio communications nets using formal or informally developed codes built upon their native languages. Their service improved the speed of encryption of communications at both ends in front line operations during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Make expressing something uncertain less concise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say that, by "default" in the languge, all verbs are completely certain. For example, let's say your word for &lt;em&gt;car&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;chicho&lt;/em&gt;, your word for &lt;em&gt;red&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;hoeng&lt;/em&gt;, and your word for &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;sherr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the sentence &lt;em&gt;chicho sherr hoeng&lt;/em&gt; translates as &lt;em&gt;the car is red&lt;/em&gt;, but it carries more certainty than it would in English—the car is &lt;em&gt;surely&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;indisputably&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;provably&lt;/em&gt; red, and for that not to be true would feel very unnatural. Finding that one's assertion was false would cause a feeling of discomfort and mild panic comparable to realizing one had skipped a sentence or phrase while delivering a speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, add an adverb &lt;em&gt;hunnyokenung&lt;/em&gt; which lowers the certainty of a verb to something closer to English. Now the sentence is &lt;em&gt;chicho sherr hunnyokenung hoeng&lt;/em&gt;. The clunkiness of the phrase reflects the fact that this construction is not used often (the elf children are taught "if you don't have anything sure to say, don't say it at all!").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A side note: literature in this language would not be able to express something surprising unless any statements that were later refuted were written using the &lt;em&gt;hunnyokenung&lt;/em&gt; form, or else the author would risk angry letters from readers complaining about the improper assertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The phonetics of these words (though not the grammar) were taken from Mandarin.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now the sentence is &lt;em&gt;chicho sherr hunnyokenung hoeng&lt;/em&gt;. The clunkiness of the phrase reflects the fact that this construction is not used often (the elf children are taught "if you don't have anything sure to say, don't say it at all!").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A side note: literature in this language would not be able to express something surprising unless any statements that were later refuted were written using the &lt;em&gt;hunnyokenung&lt;/em&gt; form, or else the author would risk angry letters from readers complaining about the improper assertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The phonetics of these words (though not the grammar) were taken from Mandarin.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A relexification of a language remains the grammar (by definition) and writing system (in practice) but gains new words. Your first (semi-)conlang was probably a relexification of English or another language.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Some use the terms cryptography and cryptology interchangeably in English, while others (including US military practice generally) use cryptography to refer specifically to the use and practice of cryptographic techniques and cryptology to refer to the combined study of cryptography and cryptanalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The idea is that the Swedes retain a small bit of what is nowadays German territory that they conquered in the 17th century. This is now independent territory, Soudway, with a language of its own named Soudwegian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their vocabulary is basically German with a lot of phonetic changes, plus a huge amount of Swedish loans (and smaller but important contributions from Polish and French), while the grammar is very simplified, like Middle/Modern English as opposed to Old English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that a realistic choice, or was the grammatic simplification that characterised the process between English/French unique&amp;mdash;not something that we should expect from other similar fusions?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, that is a realistic choice in fictive works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstractly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nobody can be 100% sure of how realistic it is, and in conlanging&amp;mdash;or even fictive worldbuilding in general&amp;mdash;you may always be a bit unrealistic. Think about some fictive works or conlangs you know placed in another world; they make many assumptions that extraterrestrial life has two eyes, hair on their head, ~1m&amp;ndash;2m tall, and their mouths have lips, teeth, an alveolar ridge, a glottis and a tongue. (Your idea takes place in our (but alternative) world, but the point of the example still stands.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linguistically&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There could be many ways of forming such a language, of which the most realistic are (chiefly from Mark Rosenfelder's &lt;em&gt;Advanced Language Construction&lt;/em&gt;):  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creole. A creole is, by &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/creole#Noun" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;definition&lt;/a&gt;, a pidgin which has native speakers. A pidgin is formed when two languages try to communicate, for reasons of trade or otherwise. If you read about &lt;em&gt;Tok Pisin&lt;/em&gt; (etymologically "talk pidgin", a creole), you'll see a lot of simplified grammar (and, as you say, English is already quite simplified).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Swedish, but developing independently from main Swedish. As a native English speaker born in Holland, informal English I use to talk to my family is very different from main English. For example, I'd say *&lt;em&gt;How late is it?&lt;/em&gt; (from Dutch &lt;em&gt;Hoe laat is het?&lt;/em&gt;) by accident. Also, lots of sound changes happen. Even though I don't merge /w/ and /ʍ/, many people I know that used to be able to can't anymore, and my rhotic in both Dutch and English is [ʁ], even though neither Dutch nor the Scottish dialect of English has it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of the two. After a period of isolation (independent development), the Swedes start talking more like the Germans (like creoles, but slightly different)&amp;mdash;a combination of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, even though it might be somewhat unrealistic, within the dome of fiction it isn't unrealistic enough to stop you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Well, in an alternate history this is a perfectly plausible scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the the German contribution to the language should be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_German" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Low German&lt;/a&gt; corresponding to the local dialects of Pommerania. It is cloaser to Swedish because the second sound shift characterising High German has not affected the Low German dialects. A good dose of loan words from High German can add some spice to Soudwegian. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the time frame you are looking at, Polish or other Slavonic influence is already very low, don't overdo it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may look at languages like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plautdietsch_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Plautdietsch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Afrikaans&lt;/a&gt; for more inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Short Answer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language used on a generation ship would change very little over the course of the journey despite its 1,000 year duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Long Answer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to widespread conventional wisdom, language drift is very modest over long periods of time in the absence of specific environmental or language contact experiences the cause a language to change over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best historical comparisons is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Icelandic language.&lt;/a&gt; It is almost unique in experiencing very little language contact or mass migration for a very long period of time. (In contrast, for example, Old English arose from the Anglo-Saxon invasion of a linguistically Celtic and Latin speaking island, and Middle English arose as the main modification in the wake of England's conquest by a French speaking Normal elite and England was extremely involved in contacting other civilizations globally as part of its diplomatic, trade and cultural interactions with Europe and as a result of its global empire.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iceland was an uninhabited island (hence not subject to any substrate influences unlike many other colonists) settled in the historic era by colonists who spoke a single shared language fairly close to "Old Norse" (the proto-language of the Germanic languages), who had a total population similar to that of a generation ship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat more subtly, Iceland's colonists were looking for economic opportunities, rather than constituting a cultural minority fleeing persecution in their homeland the way, for example, that the Puritan colonists of New England were, so they were not motivated at the outset to intentionally set out to put linguistic and cultural distance between themselves and the speakers of their original mother tongue the way that early Americans deliberately attempted to distinguish themselves linguistically from England to assert a distinct cultural identity. The Iceland situation of a group of people not committed ideologically to putting cultural distance between themselves and their ancestor population would likely also be true of the people on a generation ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The descendants of the original colonists of Iceland remained in constant communication with each other ever after, just as generation ship residents would, although this did break up from a single community into about a dozen or so chiefdoms that were substantially autonomous from each other and had distinct identities although they did retain a very thin form of island-wide weak government. So, tribal divisions, per se, do not distinguish a generation ship from Iceland. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, Iceland received almost no significant waves of migration prior to the recent past, so it has never had a large community of outside language learners to influence its linguistic development (just as would be the case in a generation ship).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Iceland wasn't as isolated from other people as generation ship would be, for a period of time roughly equal to the length of a generation ship journey prior to the introduction of telecommunications, Iceland was very isolated from the rest of the world, and the vast majority of what little contact it did have with the rest of the world from visiting ships was with people who spoke the closest linguistic relative of their language in the world. So, it did not have any languages from which to borrow words, and it was not subject to any areal effects from neighboring languages in a significant way (apart from Danish rule whose effect is noted below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icelandic is by far the most linguistically static of the Germanic languages, with the only significant change being a change in pronunciation that arose during a several century period of Danish rule, a country that speaks a closely related by different language derived from Old Norse. A generation ship would not experience this outside influence and would not need to develop a new written language as Iceland did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Wikipedia explains (at the link above):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The oldest preserved texts in Icelandic were written around 1100 AD.
  Much of the texts are based on poetry and laws traditionally preserved
  orally. The most famous of the texts, which were written in Iceland
  from the 12th century onward, are the Icelandic Sagas. They comprise
  the historical works and the eddaic poems.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The language of the sagas is Old Icelandic, a western dialect of Old
  Norse. The Dano-Norwegian, then later Danish rule of Iceland from 1536
  to 1918 had little effect on the evolution of Icelandic (in contrary
  to the Norwegian language), which remained in daily use among the
  general population. Though more archaic than the other living Germanic
  languages, Icelandic changed markedly in pronunciation from the 12th
  to the 16th century, especially in vowels (in particular, á, æ, au,
  and y/ý).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The modern Icelandic alphabet has developed from a standard
  established in the 19th century, primarily by the Danish linguist
  Rasmus Rask. It is based strongly on an orthography laid out in the
  early 12th century by a mysterious document referred to as The First
  Grammatical Treatise by an anonymous author, who has later been
  referred to as the First Grammarian. The later Rasmus Rask standard
  was a re-creation of the old treatise, with some changes to fit
  concurrent Germanic conventions, such as the exclusive use of k rather
  than c. Various archaic features, as the letter ð, had not been used
  much in later centuries. Rask's standard constituted a major change in
  practice. Later 20th-century changes include the use of é instead of
  je and the removal of z from the Icelandic alphabet in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apart from the addition of new vocabulary, written Icelandic has not
  changed substantially since the 11th century, when the first texts
  were written on vellum. Modern speakers can understand the
  original sagas and Eddas which were written about eight hundred years
  ago.&lt;/strong&gt; The sagas are usually read with updated modern spelling and
  footnotes but otherwise intact (as with modern English readers of
  Shakespeare). With some effort, many Icelanders can also understand
  the original manuscripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, usually new vocabulary is developed in response to new topics of conversation. Since the environment would change less and there would be fewer new things on a generation ship than in Iceland over the same time period (in part, due to a generation ship's lack of trade with the outside world that Iceland had) one would expect there to be less innovation in vocabulary on a generation ship than there was in Iceland. Still, as noted by @Hyperneutrino one might expect words that residents of a generation ship have no reason to use to be lost early on from popular speech (although presumably written sources would still preserve the old words for those so inclined, as a generation ship's residents would not be illiterate and written languages stabilize spelling and prevent old words from dying completely), and there would be a few new words developed over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another clue with which I have first hand experience, which corroborates the example of Iceland, is the development of motherland languages in immigrant communities. For example, the dialect of Korean spoken in Korean immigrant communities in the U.S. that formed shortly after the Korean War is much more similar to the dialect spoken at the time of migration than the dialect of Korean currently spoken in South Korea, notwithstanding the fact that there have been many visits to South Korea and there has been access to modern Korean television and music in that time period in the U.S. Small, relatively isolated communities are simply much less linguistically innovative than large communities that are strongly connected to neighboring communities that speak different languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary then, it is likely that the language of a generation ship would be extremely static over a period of approximately 1,000 years, because generally speaking it would be in conditions very similar to those of Iceland which historically has had an extremely static language over a similar time period under similar conditions. And, several of the factors that are know to have led to the modest changes between Old Icelandic and Modern Iceland over that time period would be absent on a generation ship.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;h1&gt;Short Answer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language used on a generation ship would change very little over the course of the journey despite its 1,000 year duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Long Answer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to widespread conventional wisdom, language drift is very modest over long periods of time in the absence of specific environmental or language contact experiences the cause a language to change over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best historical comparisons is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Icelandic language.&lt;/a&gt; It is almost unique in experiencing very little language contact or mass migration for a very long period of time. (In contrast, for example, Old English arose from the Anglo-Saxon invasion of a linguistically Celtic and Latin speaking island, and Middle English arose as the main modification in the wake of England's conquest by a French speaking Normal elite and England was extremely involved in contacting other civilizations globally as part of its diplomatic, trade and cultural interactions with Europe and as a result of its global empire.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iceland was an uninhabited island (hence not subject to any substrate influences unlike many other colonists) settled in the historic era by colonists who spoke a single shared language fairly close to "Old Norse" (the proto-language of the Germanic languages), who had a total population similar to that of a generation ship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat more subtly, Iceland's colonists were looking for economic opportunities, rather than constituting a cultural minority fleeing persecution in their homeland the way, for example, that the Puritan colonists of New England were, so they were not motivated at the outset to intentionally set out to put linguistic and cultural distance between themselves and the speakers of their original mother tongue the way that early Americans deliberately attempted to distinguish themselves linguistically from England to assert a distinct cultural identity. The Iceland situation of a group of people not committed ideologically to putting cultural distance between themselves and their ancestor population would likely also be true of the people on a generation ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The descendants of the original colonists of Iceland remained in constant communication with each other ever after, just as generation ship residents would, although this did break up from a single community into about a dozen or so chiefdoms that were substantially autonomous from each other and had distinct identities although they did retain a very thin form of island-wide weak government. So, tribal divisions, per se, do not distinguish a generation ship from Iceland. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, Iceland received almost no significant waves of migration prior to the recent past, so it has never had a large community of outside language learners to influence its linguistic development (just as would be the case in a generation ship).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Iceland wasn't as isolated from other people as generation ship would be, for a period of time roughly equal to the length of a generation ship journey prior to the introduction of telecommunications, Iceland was very isolated from the rest of the world, and the vast majority of what little contact it did have with the rest of the world from visiting ships was with people who spoke the closest linguistic relative of their language in the world. So, it did not have any languages from which to borrow words, and it was not subject to any areal effects from neighboring languages in a significant way (apart from Danish rule whose effect is noted below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icelandic is by far the most linguistically static of the Germanic languages, with the only significant change being a change in pronunciation that arose during a several century period of Danish rule, a country that speaks a closely related by different language derived from Old Norse. A generation ship would not experience this outside influence and would not need to develop a new written language as Iceland did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Wikipedia explains (at the link above):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The oldest preserved texts in Icelandic were written around 1100 AD.
  Much of the texts are based on poetry and laws traditionally preserved
  orally. The most famous of the texts, which were written in Iceland
  from the 12th century onward, are the Icelandic Sagas. They comprise
  the historical works and the eddaic poems.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The language of the sagas is Old Icelandic, a western dialect of Old
  Norse. The Dano-Norwegian, then later Danish rule of Iceland from 1536
  to 1918 had little effect on the evolution of Icelandic (in contrary
  to the Norwegian language), which remained in daily use among the
  general population. Though more archaic than the other living Germanic
  languages, Icelandic changed markedly in pronunciation from the 12th
  to the 16th century, especially in vowels (in particular, á, æ, au,
  and y/ý).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The modern Icelandic alphabet has developed from a standard
  established in the 19th century, primarily by the Danish linguist
  Rasmus Rask. It is based strongly on an orthography laid out in the
  early 12th century by a mysterious document referred to as The First
  Grammatical Treatise by an anonymous author, who has later been
  referred to as the First Grammarian. The later Rasmus Rask standard
  was a re-creation of the old treatise, with some changes to fit
  concurrent Germanic conventions, such as the exclusive use of k rather
  than c. Various archaic features, as the letter ð, had not been used
  much in later centuries. Rask's standard constituted a major change in
  practice. Later 20th-century changes include the use of é instead of
  je and the removal of z from the Icelandic alphabet in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apart from the addition of new vocabulary, written Icelandic has not
  changed substantially since the 11th century, when the first texts
  were written on vellum. Modern speakers can understand the
  original sagas and Eddas which were written about eight hundred years
  ago.&lt;/strong&gt; The sagas are usually read with updated modern spelling and
  footnotes but otherwise intact (as with modern English readers of
  Shakespeare). With some effort, many Icelanders can also understand
  the original manuscripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, usually new vocabulary is developed in response to new topics of conversation. Since the environment would change less and there would be fewer new things on a generation ship than in Iceland over the same time period (in part, due to a generation ship's lack of trade with the outside world that Iceland had) one would expect there to be less innovation in vocabulary on a generation ship than there was in Iceland. Still, as noted by @Hyperneutrino one might expect words that residents of a generation ship have no reason to use to be lost early on from popular speech (although presumably written sources would still preserve the old words for those so inclined, as a generation ship's residents would not be illiterate and written languages stabilize spelling and prevent old words from dying completely), and there would be a few new words developed over time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There is Lingua Franca Nova, which was named after the original Lingua Franca (yes, there really was once a language called Lingua Franca, it was used by traders in the Mediterranean I believe). But all he had to go off of was the languages it drew its (initial) vocabulary from, knowledge of how creoles develop, and two sentences in the original Lingua Franca which he had no translation to at the time. Lingua Franca Nova is so close to the original, that many think he actually replicated the original Lingua Franca, unaware that he had little to no knowledge of it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A benefit to having irregular verbs in your conlang is shortening common words. If common words like "to be" and "to walk" were 4-5 syllables in some conjugations, your speakers might consider it a hassle to say those gigantic words all the time, whereas less regular, but shorter forms of the conjugations might be easier to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though really, it depends on what you want in your conlang. If you're going for naturalism, some irregularities are a must, but if you're going for an auxlang, avoiding irregular conjugations (or possibly even conjugations altogether) would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;What notation do constructed sign languages use?&lt;br&gt;
Many well-known big sign languages (such as ASL) have their own form of notation, but that notation is very specific and may not be able to express a sign in other sign languages. For example, ASL &lt;em&gt;school&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;OpenB@Palm-PalmDown-OpenB@CenterChesthigh-PalmUp Contact Contact
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but some constructed sign language X might require signals that don't appear in ASL, like 'touch your elbow with the thumb of your non-dominant hand'. The notation could be extended but would be complicating it. Language X thus requires its own system for its own signs or an 'international' one in analogy with the International Phonetic Alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the notations commonly used by constructed sign languages?&lt;br&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are very few constructed sign languages. On the subreddit, we sometimes get questions about whether anyone has made any, which usually don’t get many replies. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/3rnhp0/any_constructed_sign_languages/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;This one here&lt;/a&gt; has some examples given, and also links a website which has basically the answer to your actual question: &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It depends. There are two extreme possibilities. I would expect the real situation to be somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One extreme happens when the population of the generation ship just speaks a random language, or several. And when it either does not bring a large library or somehow manages to lose or forget it (e.g. due to religious extremism).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case there will be natural language change. Here are some things that fuel language change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The desire of a younger generation to assert their identity linguistically gives rise to youth language. As they grow older, part of their youth language becomes standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unstressed syllables are pronounced less and less carefully, giving rise to phonetic changes. E.g., several distinctive vowels may merge into a single neutral vowel when unstressed. Vowels or consonants may even get lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The desire to express ourselves drastically in certain situation gives rise to new rules of grammar. E.g., this is how the future tense and the progressive aspect in English arose. (Neither existed in Proto-Germanic.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a word or expression is used increasingly in a specific sense, sometimes it is no longer appropriate to use it in its original sense. This drift of meaning then creates a gap that will likely be filled by a new word or expression or by initiating a similar process for another, existing one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these factors exist on a generation ship. As ohwilleke pointed out, two other factors - changing environment and contact with other languages (which also evolve) do not exist on a generation ship. (At least in the long run. Of course the first few generations will adapt their vocabulary and probably even grammar to the unique situation. E.g., some Australian languages use compass directions or geographical directions w.r.t. a specific valley instead of left and right. Something equivalent would make even more sense on a generation ship.) Therefore we can expect this language change to be really slow. Ohwilleke's example of Iceland gives us an idea of what to expect. If the ship's population starts with English, then after 1000 years they have a good chance to understand today's English to some extent. (To a greater extent if they continue reading books in today's English.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since, realistically, a generation ship to Alpha Centauri would be travelling for many thousands of years, without further stabilising factors we can expect that they would arrive speaking a language that is at most vaguely similar to the one they started with. I would not expect this language to have unusual features compared to languages currently spoken on Earth. There might, however, be some grammatical structures related to the special situation on the ship. And there might also be a large number of irregularities, as is often the case for languages of small speaker communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A generation ship will probably bring a large library. However, if the population had unrestricted access to it, this might lead to a society that basically lives in the past and will be unable to settle a new planet. But in any case I would expect that some people on board continue to learn Earth languages so they can understand part of that library. Depending on the precise circumstances, this could be a stabilising factor or even fuel language change due to different Earth languages being fashionable at different times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A civilisation that wants to control the language spoken by the settlers of a distant planet will have to turn linguistics from a descriptive science into a field of engineering. They may be able to create a language that is a lot more stable than any naturally occurring language. This doesn't mean there is no change at all, but it means that significant change is normally cyclic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language change is already largely cyclic in terms of high-level features of languages. E.g., if a language does not have a past tense, then a composite tense like present perfect will likely come up to fill this gap. The auxiliaries will then merge with the verbs that carry the meaning, becoming suffixes or prefixes. They will slowly lose stress, become unrecognisable as auxiliaries, become indistinguishable from each other and finally will disappear, so that the language again doesn't have a past tense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an isolated speaker community, it might be possible to come up with a language A such that after one such cycle a language B results that is mutually intelligible with A to a strong degree. Now the speakers of B will likely read a lot of the literary output of the speakers of A, leading to further stabilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extending this idea, we one might come up with a family of languages that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; in principle have cyclically evolved out of each other. Say half a dozen such languages. By providing an extensive and stimulating library in all of these languages, it could be possible to make language evolution essentially cyclic throughout the flight, so that at the end everyone will be speaking a variation of one of the library languages (possibly an intermediate stage). But it also seems likely that this would lead to a multilingual situation (with several library languages spoken simultaneously), so that one would also have to consider contact effects between these languages. And, perhaps more importantly, to conscious efforts to create linguistic innovations that are not represented in the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I arrived at these last thoughts from a different angle. In the extreme case, success of an international language such as Esperanto would mean that everybody in the world speaks Esperanto and only Esperanto. But this is not a stable situation, at least not with an essentially random language such as Esperanto. So I thought about whether there can be a language that would remain the only language spoken on Earth once it managed to get to that point.&lt;/p&gt;

Depending on the precise circumstances, this could be a stabilising factor or even fuel language change due to different Earth languages being fashionable at different times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A civilisation that wants to control the language spoken by the settlers of a distant planet will have to turn linguistics from a descriptive science into a field of engineering. They may be able to create a language that is a lot more stable than any naturally occurring language. This doesn't mean there is no change at all, but it means that significant change is normally cyclic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language change is already largely cyclic in terms of high-level features of languages. E.g., if a language does not have a past tense, then a composite tense like present perfect will likely come up to fill this gap. The auxiliaries will then merge with the verbs that carry the meaning, becoming suffixes or prefixes. They will slowly lose stress, become unrecognisable as auxiliaries, become indistinguishable from each other and finally will disappear, so that the language again doesn't have a past tense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an isolated speaker community, it might be possible to come up with a language A such that after one such cycle a language B results that is mutually intelligible with A to a strong degree. Now the speakers of B will likely read a lot of the literary output of the speakers of A, leading to further stabilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extending this idea, we one might come up with a family of languages that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; in principle have cyclically evolved out of each other. Say half a dozen such languages. By providing an extensive and stimulating library in all of these languages, it could be possible to make language evolution essentially cyclic throughout the flight, so that at the end everyone will be speaking a variation of one of the library languages (possibly an intermediate stage). But it also seems likely that this would lead to a multilingual situation (with several library languages spoken simultaneously), so that one would also have to consider contact effects between these languages. And, perhaps more importantly, to conscious efforts to create linguistic innovations that are not represented in the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I arrived at these last thoughts from a different angle. In the extreme case, success of an international language such as Esperanto would mean that everybody in the world speaks Esperanto and only Esperanto. But this is not a stable situation, at least not with an essentially random language such as Esperanto. So I thought about whether there can be a language that would remain the only language spoken on Earth once it managed to get to that point.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently read an interesting essay – wish I could remember where – saying that the more insular a language community is, i.e. the less likely someone is to converse in that language with a stranger, the less it uses syntactic complexities such as relative clauses, because you don't need to clarify your context if your interlocutor already shares most of your context.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that's true, the effect is likely to show if the ship's population stays within a small multiple of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dunbar limit&lt;/a&gt;.  Such simplification might in turn allow word order to become more free, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A generation ship is a small society that is technologically advanced but stagnant. It's a society that depends on ancient wisdom to survive. Their material and intellectual resources are very limited compared to the civilization they came from, so the rate of scientific and technological advancement will be slow. Most of their efforts in those fields must go into maintaining a sufficient understanding of the ship and the science behind it to keep the systems operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For similar reasons, most of the entertainment the people consume will be from the civilization of their origin. Some new entertainment will be produced, but in limited quantity and with lower production values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of limited resources, I would expect that everyone on board would be bilingual. There would be an everyday language that would drift and evolve, as others have already discussed. There would also be the ancient language of entertainment, higher education, and operations manuals that would remain static by necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bilingual people tend to mix the languages when talking with each other. This would make the evolution of the everyday language different from what we have seen on Earth. Because the original language would still be in active use, the everyday language would sometimes drift away from it and sometimes be influenced by it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It’s relatively hard to say. First, some general numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 1000 years, Old High German split into the various southern German dialects, including Swiss German and Standard German. While differences are very noticable, many developments were parallel and speakers usually don’t take long to get accustomed to the differences. A similar time depth can be claimed for English vs Scots. Old High German itself is not readily intelligible to the modern speaker, but many words are recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2000 years ago, we had Latin and Proto-Germanic, the ancestors of the Romance and Germanic branches of Indo-European. While the modern languages all show clear similarities in most regards of the language, they are as a general rule not mutually intelligible and speakers need to invest a lot of time to learn another of those languages - but still much less than with an unrelated language. Proto-Germanic and Latin are both quite different than the modern languages, showing vast differences in morphology and syntax, as well as having undergone many sound changes since. Nevertheless, with some knowledge on etymology, words can readily be recognized for what they are in a written text. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 4000-6000 years ago, we have PIE. At this point, the language is no longer immediately recognizable as being related to a modern European language. The grammar is very different - just as an example, PIE verbs inflect for three persons and three numbers, but not directly for tense or aspect, which are instead marked with various more-or-less productive derivational affixes. The phonology would also look very out of place in modern day Europe. And for most roots, even if they didn’t change much phonologically, there was probably a semantic shift somewhere between PIE and English. The average English speaker will understand exactly zero words in a passage in Serbian or Punjabi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s another side to this as well. General tendencies are fine, but what about individual languages? If you compare Italian and French to Latin, then it’s plainly obvious that French has changed more, at least with regards to phonology and morphology. Similarly, comparing English to Icelandic, the latter is clearly more conservative (though no where near as much as some people might make you believe). To me, French and English look like they are 500+ years further in the future than their contemporary siblings — in reality of course they just underwent some more drastical sound changes that in turn messed with their morphology, which in turn forced changes to the syntax. People try to ascribe those changes to various factors, usually external ones such as a large number of foreign learners, but most of this is not grounded in actual science and just speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, no definitive answer can be given. I find the time depths I gave above to be good rules of thumb, but single languages may deviate from those quite a bit. To achieve such results, it’s important to apply changes not only to the phonology, but to all parts of the language — especially the lexicon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As described &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/329/what-is-the-difference-between-tense-and-aspect"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Aspect&lt;/em&gt; refers to the grammatical marking of the relation between topic and eventuality &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;, that is, it marking in what way the time an action actually occurs relates to the time currently being talked about. So in the sentence “Before returning home, he had gone shopping”, the topic time would be the moment of arriving home, and the eventuality time the time of going shopping, and the English past perfect marks that the latter happened before the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A logical extension of this system then would be to not only mark for differences in topic and eventuality &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;, but also topic and eventuality &lt;em&gt;space&lt;/em&gt;. In the above sentence, the topic space (or location) would be the home, while the location of the shopping would be the eventuality space. The sentence might then mark for the fact that the shopping center is far away from the home, as opposed to (for example), inside the home. Further distinctions could be made with regards to motion: shopping is fairly stationary, but in “To get home, he had to drive on the highway”, there is clear motion towards the topic space and this too might be marked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am curious, does anything along these lines exist in natural languages? The closest thing I was able to find were &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andative_and_venitive" rel="noreferrer"&gt;cis- and translocative markers&lt;/a&gt; in some languages, but the examples don’t really make it clear that this is used in a mandatory inflectional manner the same way temporal aspect is in many language.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I don't know of any languages where spatial marking is thoroughly compulsory in the same way aspect often is, however I do know of some potentially interesting cases of spatial marking. A lot of Papuan languages have grammaticalised systems for showing directionality and location. They are usually described as being relative to the speaker, but in at least some cases I have found them described as being relative to either the speaker or the village, or some other not wholly speaker-focussed system. The Nimboran languages in particular have highly complex systems e.g. &lt;a href="http://papuaweb.org/dlib/irian/5-2.PDF" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wilden(1976)&lt;/a&gt; describes Kemtuk as having the following system: &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/cYKT8xS.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;https://i.imgur.com/cYKT8xS.png&lt;/a&gt;, but says that it is optional.  &lt;a href="http://www.oapen.org/download?type=document&amp;docid=613375" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Anceaux (1965)&lt;/a&gt; describes 16 different spatial categories in Nimboran proper, but in a rather unhelpful manner. He notes that the unmarked position category, when the speaker is involved has a specific meaning of "near the speaker", but that it is also always used when the speakers position is indefinite or irrelevant, such as in stories or general statements. In at least some languages I have looked at, these markers were compulsory with motion verbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A somewhat different system involving location relative to other events is described by &lt;a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ling.1973.11.issue-110/ling.1973.11.110.43/ling.1973.11.110.43.xml" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Huisman (1973)&lt;/a&gt; who reports that Angaataha has a class of medial verbs which are inflected for whether they occur in the same place or in a different place as the following conjunct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, none of this completely satisfies your request, but it shows that at least some things are definitely attested, and distinguish other, or more fine categories than what you've found yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about languages spoken by a small community in isolated islands are the Polynesian languages, like Maori, Hawai'i and Rapa Nui. They have simple phonetic inventories and little to no inflexion, but have a huge array of particles that denote aspect, mood, tense, emotion, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, at the same time we can look at Papua New Guinea, where there are hundreds of languages spoken by isolated communities. PNG is a bit "problematic", though, because there are so many types of languages there, from analytical to polysynthetic, from small to very large phonemic inventories. It's kind of a linguistic hotspot, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice for you is to check out Polynesian languages but also take a look at some PNG cultures. They can offer some insight you won't get anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;At the moment I have my fictional language written down in a notebook, but as the vocabulary increases its becoming harder and harder to find words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am adding new words all the time, so writing them in alphabetical order doesn't last long.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I keep a track of this language and still be able to find the words I need?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: I have seen this question has been marked as a possible duplicate, but it is different as I am also open to paper-and-pencil methods.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One way, while working on paper is to divide things into multiple sheets, making sure to have plenty of extra space at the bottom of dictionary sheets, or alternatively grouping things via e.g. semantic field to not run into the alphabetisation issue to quite the same extent (though this can have the issue that the semantic field of some items might not be easily determineable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use a computer program to manage your vocabulary, which offers the benefits of easy searchability and ordering. A simple spreadsheet program of your choosing is enough to work in a lot of cases, and otherwise there is the possibility of using actual vocabulary management programs. There are several free ones availible, both conlang-specific ones such as &lt;a href="https://draquet.github.io/PolyGlot/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Polyglot&lt;/a&gt; (which also has a bunch of other functionality for organising a bunch of other conlanging-related stuff) or one developed for natlangs but still useful for conlangs, such as &lt;a href="https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;SIL FieldWorks&lt;/a&gt; (which is quite powerful but has a bit of a learning curve).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;While international auxiliary conlangs based on Romance languages, such as the ones you're thinking of, typically get rid of most of the verbal conjugation, there are in fact naturalistic Romance-based conlangs that retain a multiplicity of verbal forms on par with French or Italian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no reason why the evolution of the actual Romance languages can't be imitated by a conlanger if they so wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example would be &lt;a href="http://thelegion.free.fr/siezan_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the Siezan language&lt;/a&gt; (created by a French conlanger that goes under the pseudonym "Legion" on the Internet), meant to represent what French would be if it were a bit more similar to the other major Romance languages. If you look at &lt;a href="http://thelegion.free.fr/siezan_verbs.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the section on verbs&lt;/a&gt;, you can find examples such as &lt;strong&gt;devre&lt;/strong&gt; 'must, to have to' having &lt;strong&gt;dúi&lt;/strong&gt; as its "indicative perfective" (or &lt;em&gt;passé simple&lt;/em&gt; if you will), which correspond to the Latin principal parts &lt;strong&gt;debere&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;debui&lt;/strong&gt; respectively. (You can compare this to the retention of Latin &lt;strong&gt;quaero&lt;/strong&gt; ~ &lt;strong&gt;quaesivi&lt;/strong&gt; in Spanish: &lt;strong&gt;quiero&lt;/strong&gt; ~ &lt;strong&gt;quise&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Latin &gt; Siezan)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;debere &gt; devre&lt;br/&gt;
debui &gt; dúi&lt;br/&gt;
debuisti &gt; dús&lt;br/&gt;
debuit &gt; dú&lt;br/&gt;
debuimus &gt; dumos&lt;br/&gt;
debuistis &gt; dustes&lt;br/&gt;
debuerunt &gt; duront&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that, just as in the real Romance languages, new principal parts can also be formed elsewhere. The future form of Siezan &lt;strong&gt;falir&lt;/strong&gt; 'to fail' has the irregular stem &lt;strong&gt;fodr-&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;fodré, fodrás, fodrá...&lt;/strong&gt;) instead of the expected &lt;em&gt;falir-&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;faliré, falirás, falirá...&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;To add to Gufferdk's answer, Mark Rosenfelder in &lt;a href="http://www.zompist.com/kit.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Language Construction Kit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (online version) mentions the use of index cards (as professional dictionary makers used to do in the past) as well as a technique with two-columned pages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can keep a dictionary in alphabetical order by maintaining two columns and just writing in one. New words get placed in the second column. When it starts to get unreadable, it’s time to make a new edition. Index cards work too, with less rewriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't mind sharing your lexicon with the entire world, there are also free online services such as &lt;a href="https://conworkshop.com/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;ConWorkShop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://anthologi.ca/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Anthologica&lt;/a&gt; where you can manage your own dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Another way to put this is, what tools exist to generate sentences in the same way that some conlanging tools generate phonotactically valid words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've heard people suggest using word generators to generate sentences. I'm open to the idea, but it seems that morphology and syntax aren't close enough and I'm not smart enough to put my finger on why. If there is a word generator that can do sentences, I'd be interested in looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example &lt;a href="http://tokipona.net/tp/LoremIpsum.aspx" rel="noreferrer"&gt;I laboriously wrote for Toki Pona&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I'm well aware there are a bunch of tools for just generating a random sampling of a dictionary, but that doesn't create syntactically valid sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I've just come across this quote from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Speech#Parallels_to_natural_languages" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russian historian Alexander Nemirovski claimed a strong similarity to Hurrian, which had recently been partially deciphered at the time of the writing of &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, E. A. Speiser's &lt;em&gt;Introduction to Hurrian&lt;/em&gt; appearing in 1941.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How similar are they, actually? What similarities do they have? Grammatical structure? Vocabulary? Is it even possible to tell, seeing how &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/q/83/32"&gt;few examples of the Black Speech we have&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One of the easiest ways is a simple document in your favorite word processor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hawarççomtar, [hawarçç- +omtar] n.C. dancer&lt;br&gt;
hawarrôs, [*wel-] n.N. the will, desire; attachment&lt;br&gt;
hawartomar, [wartam &lt; *wert-] n.N. spiritual awakening, spiritual awareness&lt;br&gt;
hawatam, [*wed-] D vb. sing&lt;br&gt;
hawatar, [*wed-] n.N. poison, medicine; saga&lt;br&gt;
hawatôs, [hawatam] n.N. song&lt;br&gt;
hawecam, [*aug-] D vb. add; grow (mid)&lt;br&gt;
hawehham, [*aukwh-] A vb. cook something (w. acc.); cook for someone (w. dat.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever etymological or grammatical information you feel like adding can be easily inserted. It's easy to insert new words or simply add them to the end of the list and have the software sort the whole thing alphabetically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One great advantage of doing it this way is that it's a trivial matter of formatting for print should you ever desire to have a printed copy of your dictionary or grammar book.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurrian_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Font of All Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. Wikipedia) tells us several things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is not much similarity as far as phonology, as Hurrian seems to lack consonant voicing distinction (except in certain circumstances). BS clearly has this distinction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's not enough BS to determine much by way of grammar, but Hurrian seems to be extremely agglutinative; BS doesn't appear to be at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hurrian seems to have more vowels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BS has more consonant clusters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon reading &lt;a href="https://zhaaburi.wordpress.com/analysis-of-the-black-speech/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;this analysis of Black Speech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I think it is clear that Professor Tolkien must have taken some words &amp; grammatical forms into BS from Hurrian. For example: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-at &lt; Hurrian -ed- formant of jussive/intended future in verbal form formant of future in verbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-ûk &lt; “All”, “completeness”; Hurrian -ok, formant with a meaning “fully, truthfully, really” in a verbal form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurrian texts were known since discoveries in the 1910s &amp; 1930s. A grammar wasn't published until 1941. Based on the Analysis, I think it very likely that Prof. Tolkien gained inspiration from the Hurrian direction. I'm not sure I'd agree with "strong similarity" based on the extreme paucity of BS evidence. More evidence, a lost grammar, those would be more convincing one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurrian_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Font of All Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. Wikipedia) tells us several things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is not much similarity as far as phonology, as Hurrian seems to lack consonant voicing distinction (except in certain circumstances). BS clearly has this distinction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's not enough BS to determine much by way of grammar, but Hurrian seems to be extremely agglutinative; BS doesn't appear to be at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hurrian seems to have more vowels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BS has more consonant clusters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;With pen and paper: Use &lt;strong&gt;index cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need two sets of index cards, one ordered alphabetically in the conlang, the other ordered alphabetically in your native language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use index cards of different colour to retrieve, e.g., roots or basic words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The index cards take up some space, but 10k of them are still managable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I use multiple sources for Lortho. For the most part, my notes are all kept on Google Docs and its lexicon is stored in Google Spreadsheets. For the display portion of the language I use three different websites: &lt;a href="https://linguifex.com/wiki/Lortho" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Linguifex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.frathwiki.com/Lortho" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;FrathWiki&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://conworkshop.info/view_language.php?l=LTH" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ConWorkShop&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, I created a challenge on Twitter and Instagram called &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lextreme2018" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lextreme2018&lt;/a&gt; which keeps track of all my new lexemes for the year and the progress of Lortho's script. As I add a new word with the challenge, I also make it a point to add the new word in both the Google Spreadsheet as well as on ConWorkShop. That way I have my dictionary stored in two separate places should one decide to go belly-up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By definition&lt;/em&gt;, aspect is defined in relation to the action's &lt;em&gt;temporality&lt;/em&gt;. As such, no there is no language, natural or otherwise with "spatial aspect".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, countless languages do incorporate spatiality in verbs, whether that be in morphology or, less commonly, in the verbal paradigm. Germanic languages particles come to mind, but Nuučaan̓uł has affixes meaning, among others "at the ear", "at the side of a vessel" and "on the beach" (&lt;em&gt;Advanced Language Construction&lt;/em&gt;, 179-180). Quechua does have (&lt;a href="https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/296550/bookpart.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;as I understand it&lt;/a&gt;) a mandatory directional -mu for verbs of movement. If absent, it explicitly excludes movement toward the speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure nothing prevents you from making spatiality the main category affecting verbal forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Words constructed arbitrarily &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; a natural language don't count here. For example, the Estonian word &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/relv" rel="noreferrer"&gt;relv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; "weapon, firearm" coined in the 20th century (probably influenced by English revolver) wouldn't count.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The verb "to grok", having been coined by Robert Heinlein for his Novel &lt;em&gt;Stranger in a Strange Land&lt;/em&gt; has gained significant popularity and is used with the same meaning as in the original language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am however not sure whether this meets the criteria of coming from a constructed language: To my knowledge the martians' language is clearly stated to be a full fledged language &lt;em&gt;inside universe of the book&lt;/em&gt;, but "to grok" is one of the few (if not only) word to be given explicitly and there does not seem to be a full-fledged grammar or lexicon anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In the novel "Autonomy", when robots speak to each other, they author expressed it in a source code-like English, with a few things you'd see in coded implementations, like mentions of files, message headers and acknowledgements, and so on. Obviously this wasn't a full implementation. If a hobbyist did do a working implementation, I figure it would be a conlang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Star Wars, the droids are supposed to speak a language. The attested text can't possibly be anything like a conlang, except maybe as a language of just "oh!", "ah!" "ha-ha!" and other emotive exclamations. If someone hobbyist tried to make a droid language, it would be a nice feature if it could both work as a natural language and a programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have speculated that Lojban could serve as a programming language, as things like Prolog are programs made out of logical statements. I haven't heard of anyone doing so. Lojban syntax is describe with the same tools as are used for writing compilers, &lt;a href="http://www.lojban.org/publications/formal-grammars/grammar.300" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;YACC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, since this website doesn't need to reproduce Stack Overflow, things that are &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; programming languages and don't have a way to be used as a natural language (except maybe in jest?) are not only not conlangs, but off topic.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if they really serve any practical advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, what they mean depends on what the innate part of speech of the root is, which isn't marked except through the part of speech endings. For instance, attaching the verbal suffix -i to an adjective gives a different meaning than attaching it to a noun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further more, Lingua Franca Nova has a rather novel method of marking mart of speech: its own derivational morphology. Unlike Esperanto's affixes, LFN's affixes often transform a specific part of speech into another (or sometimes just leaves it the same). In this say, suffixes that derive nouns are automatically mark the noun for part of speech without the need of an additional affix that serves no other purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, I'm not exactly fluent in the language myself, so I'd like an opinion from people who do actually know and use this language. Are the part of speech endings really useful or are they just a convoluted way to derive new words?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;POS markers are markers, same as syntactic position, both derived morphology and otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a noisy environment it may be helpful to mark things more than once, so if someone couldn't figure out the POS from context, the roots normal POS class, or syntax, they can infer it from the POS suffix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy has some additional criticism of the &lt;a href="http://inf.ufrgs.br/~vbuaraujo/misc/kontrauranto/#g" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;POS markers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've no familiarity with LNF, so I wouldn't know how that differs or not.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with Esperanto POS suffixes, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-o noun  
-i verb (infinitive)  
-a adjective 
-e adverb 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sano - health 
sani - to be healthy
sana - healthy
sane - healthily
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Esperanto has free word order, having POS markers allows the differentiation between the following phrases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ĝoje knabino ludas - a girl plays happily
ĝoja knabino ludas - a happy girl plays
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto and LFN have a very similar affix system, however unlike LFN, Esperanto root words have no innate part of speech, so there is no way of "adding" a verbal suffix to a noun or an adjective. Rather, you would be changing the nominal/adjectival suffix to the verbal one and forming the verb based on the root word. Knowing the POS of any given word makes understanding unfamiliar words a lot easier, which is very advantageous for an auxiliary language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, in EO poetry, nouns often drop their -o ending for aesthetic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Berlino sen vi estas urb' (urbo) sen harmoni' (harmonio)&lt;br&gt;
  Estas trista, trista, amasloĝej' (amasloĝejo)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between EO and LFN's, there is no "better" affix system. They are just two different ways of doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Since&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's really hard to conceive of a human language whose grammar and syntax are truly outside the bound of what exists in natural language (despite Lojban fanboy statements to the contrary) to the point that the Leipzig rules can't be used for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Leipzig rules already are already designed to handle human languages, and human languages can get pretty ridiculous already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't see what's the problem. You don't have to go the strict way either, you can be as specific or as generic as your example needs to be, but the Leipzig rules are always a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, people are more likely to argue about the terminology (i.e. which abbreviation you're using, again as in your own Lojban example) or what words to use to gloss something than about the application of Leipzig proper.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should we expect Leipzig Glossing Rules to work for all invented languages?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them, but the set of languages for which they will not work is exceedingly restricted. Basically, just ask yourself "can my language be written in a primarily linear format?" If so, the Leipzig Glossing Rules are for you. If it is carried by sound, you can gloss it. That right there covers very nearly every language that has been asked about on this site so far. If it's a manual sign language, there's still an exceedingly good chance that you can gloss it. If it's a fully-2D non-linear writing system, the alterations you will have to make to the conventions to make it work then become sufficiently large that it would no longer make sense to call the result "Leipzig glossing". But those aren't exactly common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does one handle grammar that may not match up with the "standard abbreviations"? Lojban comes to mind, since they as a community reject that grammatical classes in Lojban have any counterpart in natural languages.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly the same way the professionals do: by providing a glossary of your non-standard abbreviations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conlang audiences are just as likely to be an amateur audience, unlike the readers of linguistics academic journal. Is there a better way to gloss for a popular audience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That depends on what you are trying to communicate to that popular audience. In some cases, a full gloss may not be needed, even for a professional audience. A simple set of parallel translations demonstrating the effect of a straightforward morphological or syntactic alternation, for example, may be sufficient for its purpose. But in the general case... I don't think so. Leipzig glosses are intended to be easy to understand, and they succeed at that about as well as it is possible to do in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Obviously, generating a lexicon is very time-consuming, and there's so much that needs to be done, I often find myself suffering with analysis paralysis, because I just can't decide where to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word frequency lists don't help all that much, because there's an inverse relationship between how useful a word is and how common it is. The most commonly used word in English is 'the', for instance. If you just made words for the 100 most commonly used words, you wouldn't really be able to make that many sentences, which would make it difficult to work on the grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen some people use the Swadesh list, but I fail to see how that is useful in any way since the list was arbitarily chosen rather than thought through. And besides, it would require you make words for things that are highly unlikely to ever be mentioned, such as a word for 'louse'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Conlanger's Lexicon suggests you work by categories, so that that way you can at least form complete sentences, even if this does limit you to writing about one topic. Of course, there's still the problem of which list to begin with. He just lists the categories in the book alphabetically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there other methods to use? And yes, I know about word-generating programs, but those spit out stuff that's much lower quality than stuff generated by hand. And besides, my conlang will have a highly productive word-derivation system, so I don't need that many roots (when I'm writing down lists of words, often times I just write what I want the compound word to literally translate as, though I rarely go back to fill it in because I never get to the words that would comprise the compound).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've mostly been looking at frequency lists and the Conlanger's Lexipedia, but I would like to know if there was a better way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Honestly, what order you build your vocabulary in doesn't much matter, as long as it remains internally consistent when it comes to your conlang's semantic and morphosyntactic rules (and frankly, even those can be retconned).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, different conlangers will build their vocabulary in different orders, and it really doesn't much matter which words you choose to coin first. I personally most often coin new words as I need them for translations (similarly, I flesh out my grammar as I encounter grammatical concepts I can't translate well in translations). I'll either find quotes to translate on my own, participate in conlanging challenges on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs" rel="noreferrer"&gt;/r/conlangs&lt;/a&gt;, or work on something like the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603121930/http://fiziwig.com/conlang/syntax_tests.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Conlanging Syntax Test&lt;/a&gt; or, yes, perhaps a Swadesh List (or one of the improved alternatives, such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig%E2%80%93Jakarta_list" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the Leipzig-Jakarta list&lt;/a&gt; -- there are a great number of such "concept lists" collected at &lt;a href="http://concepticon.clld.org/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;CLLD-Concepticon&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, these choices are incredibly arbitrary, but frankly, there isn't any way of choosing what words to coin first that &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; arbitrary. So just pick something arbitrarily and get started!&lt;/p&gt;

Many of the main links on &lt;a href="https://www.sidosi.org/resources" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sidosi's Resources page&lt;/a&gt; are unreliable, but you can view the archived copies by expanding the info box for a resource (click the + to the left of the title), or clicking the "Show/Hide All" link near the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, there is a &lt;a href="https://www.sidosi.org/resources-beta" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;beta Resources page&lt;/a&gt; that hasn't been widely publicized yet, and it presents the resources in a much better format than before, with no broken links. It's only considered beta because this new version was coded from scratch, and there are a ton of new resources due to be added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still many original French documents that haven't been translated to English (Sudre's book, for example), so the Solresol community as a whole shares in your struggle for English resources. Basically, there still aren't any good English resources for learning Solresol, but hopefully the ones that are available help.&lt;/p&gt;

The advantage of this method is that if you are creating a language for a specific genre then you can use books from that genre to get a more useful vocabulary for what you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Every natural language has more or less &lt;em&gt;loanwords&lt;/em&gt;. Adding some loanwords to your conlang adds to the naturalness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do loanwords differ from the original words, after all it is a conlang and the loanwords are constructed, too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the donor language have a different phonology and different phonotactics, than the loan words stick out by their shape. You may choose a classical precursor of your actual language as the donor language (We see borrowings from Latin in French), or an unrelated language. Also the loan words may have a different stress pattern preserved in your conlang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loan words may also have unusual endings or prefixes not occurring naturally in your main conlang, or show different mechanisms of word formation and derivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to go a little further, the loan words even may exhibit loan inflections (just as some English loaned plurals such as &lt;em&gt;hippopotami&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;cherubim&lt;/em&gt; do).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There is one big point here that really ties it all together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Languages have history&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any conlang that wishes to look naturalistic therefore needs to emulate history as well. I’ll show in what ways history can manifest with a bunch of examples from different areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orthography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost no language with a history of writing has a fully regular orthography. Even if there are regular writing reforms, some aspects of the orthography will just be considered “part of it” and stick. English is of course a very extreme example of this, but you don’t need to take it that far. German for example generally has a rather regular orthography. But the digraph ⟨ie⟩ represents a long /iː/, reflecting that in the past (and in some dialects until the present) there was a diphthong /iə/ in German, which became to be pronounced that way. It also has two separate graphemes for the phonemes /ɛ eː/, namely ⟨e ä⟩, reflecting whether the sound originates from a fronted /a aː/ or not. On top of this, there are some segments which have unpredictable pronunciation: word final -ig for example is pronounced /ɪç/ instead of expected /ɪk/. In short, unless your writing system was designed very recently by linguists, it likely shows leftovers from the past. In the most extreme cases, writing systems can lag behind centuries (English, French, Tibetan), but even if they don’t they can preserve some old features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morphology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most languages with inflections show some degree of irregularity among them. This can manifest in many degrees, from almost entirely regular (Swahili has only one class of six slightly irregular verbs, one of which is suppletive in the present tense) to a basically complete lack of predictability (&lt;a href="http://linguistics.byu.edu/faculty/eddingtond/navajo.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Navajo verb stems&lt;/a&gt; have defied any attempts to find rules for their inflections thus far. There don’t seem to be distinct paradigms, every verb does its own thing!). However, these irregularities are not random. To show what I mean, compare these two sets of declensions. The first two are latin singular nouns (in an less traditional order), the second two made up on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NOM filius rēx      kwero   tulya   
VOC filiī  rēx      kwerap  tulte
ACC filium rēgem    kweruf  tultsu
GEN filiī  rēgis    kwerim  tulne
DAT filiō  rēgī     kwerx   tulum
ABL filiō  rēge     kwert   tulwo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things should stick out: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Latin forms of rēx show two distinct stems, those ending in /k/ (rēx, where the spelling hides the fact that really it’s rēc-s) and those ending in /g/ (all other forms). Looking a bit closer, we can see that the /g/ appears exactly before those forms with a vowel in the suffix. Intervocalic voicing (which accounts for /k/ becoming /g/) is a common sound change and applies here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in both languages, some of the affixes seem to be unrelated, there are still patterns: nominative takes -s, accusative takes -m, genitive has an -i in the suffix… If we added other paradigms into the comparison, even more such patterns would arise, indicating that they really originate from a much more regular system that got changed up over time by various factors like sound changes. In the made up language, on the other hand, the affixes are entirely random, and this causes the irregularity to look more unnatural than if everything took the same affixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phonology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Consonants" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Japanese consonant inventory&lt;/a&gt;. It looks something like this (omitting allophones):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  m |   n |   ɴ |
p b | t d | k g |
    | s z |     | h
    |   r |     |
    |   j |   w |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this table does not show however is that /p/ is significantly rarer than /t k/. Why would that be? Simply because many instances of that sound somewhat recently shifted to what is /h/ in modern Japanese. In other words, a sound change caused a significant imbalance in the distribution of sounds. If one were to simply generate words with a word generator, not paying attention to the history of the language, all sounds would show up with similar frequency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vocabulary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I give you any word, you can probably find several alternative ways of expressing that meaning. “big”, “tall”, “large”, “spacious”, “gigantic”… they all have different connotations, sure, but in the end they’re all descriptions for roughly the same thing - objects which take up a big fraction of your field of view when near them. Meanwhile, many conlangs will have a dictionary entry like &lt;strong&gt;gwop&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;adj&lt;/em&gt; “big” and that’s it. Adding synonyms, especially ones with subtly different meanings allows you to greatly affect the way texts read (in a positive way). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time however, often complicated words are derived from simpler concepts. This naturally has the effect of making them longer, causing a variation in the lengths of words - many short words with a few longer ones in-between is a common pattern. But if you simply create a new root every time you make a word, you won’t get that - and your hypothetical speakers will have to remember every single word without help, even ones they barely ever use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on and list things in every category of linguistics I can think of, but in the end it all boils down to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irregularity in languages either preserves older, then-regular systems in now untransparent ways (English verbs are another great case study for this) or are the creation of sound change messing with regularity. The former is the reason why common words tend to be less regular - if you commonly hear a word it’s easier to preserve its original form and remember the irregularity once it has arisen. In the case of Navajo I mentioned above, curiously it seems to be that first sound change caused irregularity, and then the native speakers applying analogy caused the whole system to become even more irregular. See the paper I linked above for some hypotheses on how that worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the actual question: Assume you have a conlang already, and it lacks history and is entirely too regular. “Sterile”, one might say. What can you do? I’d like to present you two options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invent a history for your language. Sketch out how your verbal system may have looked in the past and see if you can lead that to some interesting irregular forms or alterations. Come up with some sound changes that may have led to the current state of the language. You don’t have to do this in great detail, but obviously (as always with conlangs) the more effort you put in, the better it will look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make your language the history. If you don’t mind your end result potentially looking vastly different from what you have now, you can decide to move the  current state of the language into the past. You may have to make some changes to vocabulary to keep it in line with technology, but otherwise there’s not really any difference between a modern language and a “proto-language”. Then, you can track its changes through history in great detail, and in doing so introduce its natural flavour. No one has to know that the proto-language you worked from was unnaturalistic (but you’ll have to live with that knowledge. Just remember that you have to start &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;, you can’t derive every conlang from the first utterances of mankind). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a footnote, I’d like to make a book recommendation: &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0805080120" rel="noreferrer"&gt;The Unfolding of Language&lt;/a&gt; by Guy Deutscher. In this book, Deutscher discusses (in a very accessible manner) exactly what this question boils down to: how and why did languages become the way they are - messy and irregular and oh so complicated. I believe every conlanger should read this book, regardless of level of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;There is one big point here that really ties it all together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Languages have history&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any conlang that wishes to look naturalistic therefore needs to emulate history as well. I’ll show in what ways history can manifest with a bunch of examples from different areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orthography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost no language with a history of writing has a fully regular orthography. Even if there are regular writing reforms, some aspects of the orthography will just be considered “part of it” and stick. English is of course a very extreme example of this, but you don’t need to take it that far. German for example generally has a rather regular orthography. But the digraph ⟨ie⟩ represents a long /iː/, reflecting that in the past (and in some dialects until the present) there was a diphthong /iə/ in German, which became to be pronounced that way. It also has two separate graphemes for the phonemes /ɛ eː/, namely ⟨e ä⟩, reflecting whether the sound originates from a fronted /a aː/ or not. On top of this, there are some segments which have unpredictable pronunciation: word final -ig for example is pronounced /ɪç/ instead of expected /ɪk/. In short, unless your writing system was designed very recently by linguists, it likely shows leftovers from the past. In the most extreme cases, writing systems can lag behind centuries (English, French, Tibetan), but even if they don’t they can preserve some old features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morphology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most languages with inflections show some degree of irregularity among them. This can manifest in many degrees, from almost entirely regular (Swahili has only one class of six slightly irregular verbs, one of which is suppletive in the present tense) to a basically complete lack of predictability (&lt;a href="http://linguistics.byu.edu/faculty/eddingtond/navajo.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Navajo verb stems&lt;/a&gt; have defied any attempts to find rules for their inflections thus far. There don’t seem to be distinct paradigms, every verb does its own thing!). However, these irregularities are not random. To show what I mean, compare these two sets of declensions. The first two are latin singular nouns (in an less traditional order), the second two made up on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NOM filius rēx      kwero   tulya   
VOC filiī  rēx      kwerap  tulte
ACC filium rēgem    kweruf  tultsu
GEN filiī  rēgis    kwerim  tulne
DAT filiō  rēgī     kwerx   tulum
ABL filiō  rēge     kwert   tulwo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things should stick out: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Latin forms of rēx show two distinct stems, those ending in /k/ (rēx, where the spelling hides the fact that really it’s rēc-s) and those ending in /g/ (all other forms). Looking a bit closer, we can see that the /g/ appears exactly before those forms with a vowel in the suffix. Intervocalic voicing (which accounts for /k/ becoming /g/) is a common sound change and applies here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in both languages, some of the affixes seem to be unrelated, there are still patterns: nominative takes -s, accusative takes -m, genitive has an -i in the suffix… If we added other paradigms into the comparison, even more such patterns would arise, indicating that they really originate from a much more regular system that got changed up over time by various factors like sound changes. In the made up language, on the other hand, the affixes are entirely random, and this causes the irregularity to look more unnatural than if everything took the same affixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phonology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Consonants" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Japanese consonant inventory&lt;/a&gt;. It looks something like this (omitting allophones):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  m |   n |   ɴ |
p b | t d | k g |
    | s z |     | h
    |   r |     |
    |   j |   w |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this table does not show however is that /p/ is significantly rarer than /t k/. Why would that be? Simply because many instances of that sound somewhat recently shifted to what is /h/ in modern Japanese. In other words, a sound change caused a significant imbalance in the distribution of sounds. If one were to simply generate words with a word generator, not paying attention to the history of the language, all sounds would show up with similar frequency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vocabulary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I give you any word, you can probably find several alternative ways of expressing that meaning. “big”, “tall”, “large”, “spacious”, “gigantic”… they all have different connotations, sure, but in the end they’re all descriptions for roughly the same thing - objects which take up a big fraction of your field of view when near them.

&lt;p&gt;The idea discussed was: &lt;strong&gt;how to build a language for formalizing every day discourse&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A language that can be understood and acted upon by both humans and computers. With the advancements in AI, crypto-currencyes, decentralization etc.. i feel this problem has become more then just the philosophical curiosity that Leibniz had. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is our general status on this issue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some &lt;strong&gt;successful / failed attempts&lt;/strong&gt; of building languages specially designed for handling legal matters ? Are there any?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It is difficult for a machine to passively understand a language (it takes tons of time with machine learning, and that's for Google). Actively, that's even more difficult, as many machine responses are pre-programmed and rarely actually generated (and in that case, mostly nonsensical, but the question isn't for sensical utterances). It will be &lt;em&gt;extremely difficult&lt;/em&gt; and without appropriate backing &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; to make one that learns a new language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the one like the Toki Pona in your question could be made. But you'd have to program most of it yourself, and in languages like Toki Pona that's easy. Try generating artlangs which more like natlangs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This doesn't mean it couldn't &lt;strong&gt;seem&lt;/strong&gt; like one.&lt;/em&gt; You could:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract text (in English or some language) from books or such. You can find enough text online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate it (i.e. Google translate) between many languages, obscuring the information. (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate it from English&amp;mdash;or better, i.e. Lojban, Esperanto, Toki Pona or raw predicate logic, as they are less complicated and easier to translate from&amp;mdash;to your conlang.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dispose of invalid sentences using some kind of lightweight parser. (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn't find any (good) generators, but you could have the first!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;If you search for the researchers mentioned in the article, you can find some of their research papers. In those, they describe their methodology. In &lt;a href="http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~kjohnson/readings/Hudson_Kam_Newport_2005%20copy.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;one paper that I looked at briefly&lt;/a&gt;, for example, they mention that they varied the consistency by making the placement of determiners random. (This is actually also mentioned in the Motherboard article).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their research seems to be focused on finding out how children can learn languages, and what universal features of languages there are, so they up the difficulty of their experimental mini-languages by using rare elements, such as OSV word order (most (Western) languages use SVO). Discovery that some mini-languages are unlearnable is thus a side-effect of pushing the limits as to what are possible human languages. From a cursory glance at several papers I'd think that you can make a language 'unlearnable' if you add some random variation and choose a lot of rare grammatical features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: in the Motherboard article they actually give a reason why no documentation of Sillyspeak is available: they want to avoid it 'escaping' into the wild, as its purpose is to be a completely unknown language to the subjects of the experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Having just started the Duolingo Klingon course, I'm wondering if anybody is using the Klingon writing system (pIqaD) at all, or whether the Latin transliteration is always used?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt; look pretty hard to learn for someone with a Western background, I tend towards the transliteration only; I guess one issue is a cursive (ie handwriting) script, as the original characters seem hard to write by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The official Klingon orthography according to &lt;a href="https://www.kli.org/about-klingon/writing-klingon/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the Klingon Language Institute&lt;/a&gt; is the Latin transcription. It is what Marc Okrand, the language's creator, developed and uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Klingon script used in from Star Trek: the Next Generation on, known as the Okuda script (Michael Okuda was the set designer for Next Generation), is used, but it's worth noting that while the sounds of Klingon have been mapped onto these letters, the movies and shows just put random jumbles of letters on signs and things (this may not be true of Star Trek: Discovery, however -- I've heard they may actually have translated the signage). It's also not the only Klingon script to have been used -- according to &lt;a href="https://www.kli.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Orthography.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;an article in HolQeD&lt;/a&gt;, the Klingon Language Institute's journal, the 1980 &lt;em&gt;U.S.S. Enterprise Officer's Manual&lt;/em&gt; (now out of print) featured a completely different Klingon script, though this one was a mere way of encoding English text rather than being mapped onto Klingon phonemes (Okrand did not publish &lt;em&gt;The Klingon Dictionary&lt;/em&gt; until 1985, after all). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this sort of background, you can by no means take for granted that the Okuda script is the "real" Klingon &lt;code&gt;pIqaD&lt;/code&gt;, even though it will be occasionally used to write Klingon. The Okrand transliteration is the only truly official orthography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, resources and activities written in Klingon are more often written using the official Okrand transliteration than with the Okuda script -- the Klingon subtitles on Star Trek: Discovery, for one example, are in the transliteration (can't make Unicode add new characters for such things, after all!) In general, you'll be fine with just the transliteration -- in fact, you may have an easier time, as the transliteration is easy to type. That said, no one will judge you if you use the Okuda script because you want the writing to feel less Terran or something.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Let's look at a made-up example. Assume that we want to apply a sound change from /g/ to /d͡ʒ/ before /e/ and /i/ in Esperanto. Then, the conjugation of the Esperanto verb &lt;em&gt;pagi&lt;/em&gt; "to pay" suddenly becomes irregular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;paĝi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;pagas&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;paĝis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;pagos&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;pagus&lt;/em&gt; (The infinitive and the past tense have a different consonant (&lt;em&gt;ĝ&lt;/em&gt;) than the rest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analogy will force one consonant for all forms but we cannot predict which one. In this respect, analogy is quite irregular, and we can end up either with the original Esperanto paradigm, or with all forms shifted to the new consonant (&lt;em&gt;paĝi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;paĝas&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;paĝis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;paĝos&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;paĝus&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analogy affects usually inflected or agglutinative word forms, such as verbs and nouns, but it can also be applied to derivational morphology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another type of analogy tries to level out differences between conjugations or declensions. Assume, your language features two different conjugations. Than borrowing an ending (or prefix, or vowel change) from one conjugation to the other is also an analogy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Apart from the already mentioned &lt;em&gt;evidentiality&lt;/em&gt;, you could look at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_modality" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;modality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This expresses a speaker's attitude using a variety of aspects, such as obligation, possibility, probability, etc. The exact set depends on the language and the linguistic framework you are using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could have a default modality of 'optionality', so the sentence &lt;em&gt;I am going to the shop&lt;/em&gt; could actually mean "I might perhaps go to the shop" -- notice how in English we use adverbials (&lt;em&gt;perhaps&lt;/em&gt;) and mood (&lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt;) to express this. In your language you would have modals for &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;, so you make explicit that you are performing an action, rather than contemplating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As dithering is the default behaviour, your linguistic features should express the &lt;strong&gt;opposite&lt;/strong&gt;, ie the rarer cases where dithering does not apply. So in a way the answer to your question of how to implement this in your language is "not at all". Because that's what you do anyway, you don't need to talk about it. But you do make explicit where it doesn't apply.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I don't think you can generally assume a strong correlation between the vocabulary of a language and culture of the kind you are asking about. Just like the "50 Eskimo words for snow" is a myth, it would also apply to other languages...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not knowing the language in question I would think that there is a cultural influence, but not as obvious as having more words in a given topic area. I would expect a fine-grained system of honorifics, expressed in, for example, different verbal affixes depending on whether you speak to someone who is superior to you or not. So you express respect by using a different form of the verb, but not a different lexical item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same would apply to other areas of discourse. Politeness markers, modality (&lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;,...) all play a role in social interaction, but do not necessarily manifest themselves directly in the vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I do not know of any tools that are specifically designed for producing syntactically valid text, but my own word generator &lt;a href="https://github.com/conlang-software-dev/Logopoeist" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Logopoeist&lt;/a&gt; could be made to work for that purpose, and it wouldn't be terribly difficult to update it to produce a program actually &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that Logopoeist already treats morphophonology as an extension of syntax, and generates words according to explicit word-syntax parse trees, rather than, e.g., just filling in slots in a CV-style syllable structure template. So, if you are able to write up a formal grammar of the language's syntax above the word level, and put it into a format that the tool can read, then you just need to replace the phoneme/grapheme lists with word lists instead (repurposing phonetic classes to serve as syntactic classes / parts of speech), and it'll spit out random sentences instead of random words.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;pIqaD shows up here and there, but in my experience (which is 20 years old, but I haven't seen much to contradict it), its use is emblematic. People will put a word up here and there, and it will appear in T-shirts; but people do not read connected texts in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is, pIqaD is indeed unwritable with a pen. I experimented in my time with ways of making it more writeable: see my handiwork at &lt;a href="http://klingonska.org/writing/examples/#nicholas" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Klingonska Akademien&lt;/a&gt;, linked from the discussion of &lt;a href="http://klingonska.org/piqad/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;some pictures of pI­qaD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Lojban is often considered unusuable by humans because of its design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better example however, may be languages that have features that humans simply can not use. For example, Elkaril has an odd grammatical feature where precise measurements can be given by how long a consonant is held, and mentions that the 'infinite space' in-between vowels can also be used to encode precise information, though I can't seem to recall what purpose that serves. Obviously, humans couldn't possibly use a language like this, and that was intentional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I limit myself to features natlangs have. Not that I try to create naturalisitic conlangs, I just do that because natlangs are of course tried and tested beyond what any conlang could be, so I can be certain that the features they have are something a human could actually use. I used to have a problem with creating weird languages that were clearly unusable by humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human minds work a specific way, and despite our diversity there ARE universals (for example, all languages have nouns and verbs, though otherwise the list of parts of speech within a language can vary widely). So there are limits to what ways a language can work. You may have some wiggle room, but you can't just make up whatever you can imagine and expect it to be usable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;This is a perpetual problem I have and I find it quite annoying. Yes, I know its kinda subjective, but that doesn't change the fact that, to me at least, my conlangs are always hideous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a recent example, my most recent conlang has agglutinating pronouns. For instance, the word for 'I' is 'ta' and the word for 'we' is 'tai' (pronounced like 'tie', minus the aspiration of course). That's not too bad. The issue is when I add the nominative marker -s: 'tas' and 'tais'. To me, 'tais' just sounds hideous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In past I think it was because I used the voiceless velar fricative far too often. But even if I don't include the phoneme my language sounds hideous, and artificial to the point that its sounds robotic. Though the latter is probably because I have a hard time NOT making conlangs 'logical'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are of course nice-sounding conlangs out there, and even natlangs, but I just can't seem to imitate the sound of any other language for some reason, and I don't get why. And I specialize in phonology, so I don't get why I can't get the sound right. Even if my conlang has the exact same phonemes, allophony, intonation, and phonotactics as a natlang, it will sound completely different and I can't figure out why. I mean, how can I screw up the latter? What am I missing?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;What you need is to adjust your &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonotactics" rel="noreferrer"&gt;phonotactics&lt;/a&gt;. Since you mention it in your question you apparently know what they are, but you aren't using them to get the sounds you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You say you find "tais" to be hideous, but you don't explain why, so let's say you don't like the way that a diphthong sounds in a closed syllable. (If this isn't the case, take this as an example for whatever the problem is.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've located the problem, you have to determine how to eliminate it by making rules for new phonotactics. You can think of lots of ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diphthong becomes a monophthong: tais &gt; &lt;strong&gt;tas&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;strong&gt;tis&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;tes&lt;/strong&gt; in a closed syllable (tas might be problematic since it creates ambiguity with the singular). Or, alternatively, two monophthongs: tais could be [ta.is] instead of [tajs]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new consonant could be placed to separate the diphthong: tais could transform into &lt;strong&gt;tayis&lt;/strong&gt;, maybe taus could be &lt;strong&gt;tawus&lt;/strong&gt; (based on a simple rule of adding y before a front vowel and w before a back vowel)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diphthong could monophthongize and simple color the next consonant: tais could be pronounced [taɕ]. You could create a pattern with other consonants, e.g. tait &gt; [tac], taid &gt; [taɟ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if some of these options are problematic in your case (maybe you don't want to "contaminate" your agglutinative language), you could still retain the phonemes /tajs/ and just have some of these options as allophones of it (so e.g. [e] or [e:] could be an allophone of /aj/ in a closed syllable, [ɕ] could be an allophone of /js/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you need to do is just determine what sounds ugly to you and create phonotactic rules that cover whatever the problem is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The obvious point is: Design your conlang for pleasantness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several conlang inventors had clear ideas about pleasantness: Zamenhof liked the sound of the Italian language and designed that into Esperanto; Tolkien liked Welsh (designed into Sindarin) and Finnish (designed into Quenya).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So "taste" different syllables and sounds, "taste" combinations of them, and than set up strong phonotactic rules forbidding ugly sounds. Whenever your morphology tries to introduce an ugly sound, think of a remedy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the morphology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply some transformation that removes the ugly sound (this also adds irregularity, naturalness, and flavour to the language); for detailed suggestions see @b a's answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think getting at a list of pleasant sound combinations (and a list of ugly ones to be avoided) is the difficult part of the program, getting rid of them once you know them is the easier task.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a less sophisticated explanation. Tastes change with exposure, so any new language sounds less pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, what sounds right or pretty, after you've gotten used to a language, are words that follow the phonotactic rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm skeptical of the idea that some sounds are apriori prettier or more pleasant.  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellar_door" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Cellar door&lt;/a&gt; sounds good because it is a perfectly ordinary bit of English phonotactics, a language Tolkien was obviously familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I know that like Star Wars' droid, Pikachu's language is just nonsense with emotionally appropriate intonation, that said...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can suprasegmental features (accent, tone, etc) encode a single three syllable word in enough different ways to get the vocabulary up to toki pona size? (about 100-125) Or up to a natural language size lexicion (say 7000-15000)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question occurred to me because Alexa has a "speak to pikachu" feature where it then pretends to let you converse with Pikachu in Pikachu-ese. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There is such thing as 'whistled' languages which rely solely on tone. Though they're all based on spoken languages. All the 'speaker' does is mimic the tonal pattern without pronouncing any phonemes. Such languages are used by hunters to communicate without alerting their quarry, because the language sounds just like bird song. But they don't use this language for most day-to-day communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for a pikachu, well their 'words' are made up of three possible syllables: pi, ka, and chu. Thus a pikachu would have a total of 3 possible one-syllable words, 9 two-syllable words, and 27 three-syllable words. As we see, words would need to get quite long to get the possible vocabulary up to 100. Using tones though would easily multiply this. Even a simple two-tone system would double the number of possible syllables. Thus the syllable count would be 6 one-syllable words, 36 two-syllable words, and 216 three-syllable words. And there are real languages that have as many as 6 tones. With such a system, a pikachu would have 18 possible syllables to work with. Of course, you could say pokemon are more sensitive to tone than humans, which could increase the number of tones beyond what any human could manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though a problem arises with cross-species communication. Obviously, no two species have the same set of syllables. Thus, for different species to be able to communicate with each other, the poke-language would probably have to be purely tonal, like a whistled language. Though you could 'multiply' the number of tones using length. A tone held for a short time could be considered a separate 'phoneme' from the same tone held longer. But we might just be fooling ourselves. The pokemon may just see a long tone as two identical tones right next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most pokemon of course aren't intelligent enough to warrant a full-fledged language. Even Toki Pona would like contain some words they wouldn't make use of. Yeah, there's things like Alakazam which have an IQ higher than humans, but of course they can communicate telepathically, which would completely remove their need to use a language. And of course, there's some that can learn human language. Team Rocket's Meowth not only can speak, but he even taught himself how to! There's also one of the early movies which features a talking slowking. And one episode of the anime has a tenacool possessing meowth and speaking through him, which would imply it knows and understands human language, but lacks the ability to actually produce human sounds. Though honestly, its astounding that any pokemon could pronounce a human language. We have a lot of features in our mouths unique to our species that allow us to talk. Some birds in the real world can mimic human speech, but they accomplish this differently from how we do. I believe there is a pokemon in one of the later generations that can mimic human speech, though it can't understand language. By the way, the franchise is quite inconsistent as to whether pokemon can understand spoken speech or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for a pikachu, well their 'words' are made up of three possible syllables: pi, ka, and chu. Thus a pikachu would have a total of 3 possible one-syllable words, 9 two-syllable words, and 27 three-syllable words. As we see, words would need to get quite long to get the possible vocabulary up to 100. Using tones though would easily multiply this. Even a simple two-tone system would double the number of possible syllables. Thus the syllable count would be 6 one-syllable words, 36 two-syllable words, and 216 three-syllable words. And there are real languages that have as many as 6 tones. With such a system, a pikachu would have 18 possible syllables to work with. Of course, you could say pokemon are more sensitive to tone than humans, which could increase the number of tones beyond what any human could manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though a problem arises with cross-species communication. Obviously, no two species have the same set of syllables. Thus, for different species to be able to communicate with each other, the poke-language would probably have to be purely tonal, like a whistled language. Though you could 'multiply' the number of tones using length. A tone held for a short time could be considered a separate 'phoneme' from the same tone held longer. But we might just be fooling ourselves. The pokemon may just see a long tone as two identical tones right next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most pokemon of course aren't intelligent enough to warrant a full-fledged language. Even Toki Pona would like contain some words they wouldn't make use of. Yeah, there's things like Alakazam which have an IQ higher than humans, but of course they can communicate telepathically, which would completely remove their need to use a language. And of course, there's some that can learn human language. Team Rocket's Meowth not only can speak, but he even taught himself how to! There's also one of the early movies which features a talking slowking. And one episode of the anime has a tenacool possessing meowth and speaking through him, which would imply it knows and understands human language, but lacks the ability to actually produce human sounds. Though honestly, its astounding that any pokemon could pronounce a human language. We have a lot of features in our mouths unique to our species that allow us to talk. Some birds in the real world can mimic human speech, but they accomplish this differently from how we do. I believe there is a pokemon in one of the later generations that can mimic human speech, though it can't understand language. By the way, the franchise is quite inconsistent as to whether pokemon can understand spoken speech or not.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;This has always been a conundrum for me. I like how grammatical case frees up word order, but hate how it puts a limit on what nouns can end in. Years ago someone told me of a natlang that uses 6 declensions, one for each vowel and the 6th for nouns that end in consonants. This allowed nouns to end in any phoneme in the language, though from my own research only plurals were allowed to end in -u. Sadly, I haven't been able to find that language again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a language, if it were to exist, would make it abnormally important to remember each noun's declension class, because what would be the nominative for one noun may be another case entirely for a different noun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it annoying that I can't find that natlang again. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; it was a part of the Slavic family, but I'm not sure. I think it was spoken like somewhere around Eastern Europe or the Caucus mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;From what I remember from the cartoon, Pikachu could only say certain permutations of its name, with any combination of vowels elongated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;3 syllables   pikat͡ʃu   8 words
2 syllables   pika      4 words
1 syllables   pi        2 words 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pikachu is also capable of producing at least 4 different tones:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tone     IPA   Made when 
High     ˥     Excited
Mid      ˧     
Rising   ˧˥    Curious
Falling  ˧˩    Disappointed
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, knowing this, Ash's pikachu should be able to say at least 584 distinct "words", which is well above the toki pona threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly it's pretty much impossible for this system to match the lexicon size of a natural language. Using an 8 tone system and adding primary and secondary stress brings the number of distinct words up to 25104, which is significantly larger than the Esperanto lexicon but still far away from that of a natural language, which is around 200K words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here on you could introduce some questionable features like 8 more tones, 7 different vocal registers, or the ability to say different permutations of its name (which is probably not as dodgy but also imagining pikachu say /ka.chu.pi/ makes me extremely uncomfortable).
The best way in my opinion would be to introduce the &lt;em&gt;syllabic thunder shock&lt;/em&gt; ⚡, which would require pikachu to release up to three thunder shocks whilst saying a word, all for the good cause of bringing the lexicon size of Pika-ese to a final 198688 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(No wonder Meowth learnt how to speak a human language, imagine being stuck with a one-syllable name.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Any declensional system that involves suffixes will limit "what nouns can end in", because nouns can only end in the declensional terminations of that language!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you maximise by disallowing repeats, you can come up with say eight stem formations and say eight cases across four numbers. If you make each of these 256 forms "unique" (such that -am never repeats) that's 256 possible syllables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;English has something like &lt;a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/64506/is-there-a-list-of-syllables-contained-in-us-english"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ten to maybe fifteen or more thousands of syllables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The number of distinct monosyllabic words in astounding. &lt;a href="https://www.ontrackreading.com/wordlists/one-syllable-words-by-vowel-sound" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lists hundreds if not several thousand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't see how it could be possible to &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; create a reasonable declensional system &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; do anything but limit what nouns can end in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any solution to this query will involve something silly like having tens of thousands of discrete morphological forms for nouns. One for each possible syllable. Or, the equally silly notion of restricting the number of valid syllables to, say, 256, thus equalling the number of nominal case endings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the lost natlang, I'll just answer the title question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several possibilities to let nouns end in any phoneme of the language and still have case inflections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most simple: Have a zero ending in the nominative singular&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base your inflection on prefixes (like in Bantu languages) or infixes (like in Semitic languages)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, inflections with thematic vowels (like in Latin and Greek) aren't particularly difficult to remember, because the thematic vowel is easily recognisable throughout the whole inflection paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS Many natural languages have only a restricted set of allowed phonemes at the end of a word. Classical Greek is an extreme example of this kind of restriction, but also German has &lt;em&gt;Auslautverhärtung&lt;/em&gt; aka &lt;em&gt;final devoicing&lt;/em&gt;: Final consonants are always devoiced. This feature does not show up in writing but only in the spoken language.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are some languages with unusually irregular plurals or verbal forms, but I don't think any language has something quite as stark as what you're demanding here. Mostly because, as you point out yourself, a system that basically makes it impossible to recognize what case a noun is in unless it was previously learned by rote would be so taxing on the mind that it would inevitably regularize to at least some degree within a few generation (French verbs in middle/old French had a very high degree of root alternation, which are now greatly reduced, and English strong verb tend to regularize too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt; have you considered a system of vowel/consonant harmony? I don't think consonant harmony is a widespread feature in any natural language, but for conlanging, the sky's the limit. This would create endings that are affect by the last sound(s) of the root and increase the options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, "every" is a conservative determiner because &lt;code&gt;every dog is brown&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;every dog is a brown dog&lt;/code&gt; – objects that are brown but not a dog don't count toward the truth of the sentence. In contrast, if we define &lt;code&gt;equi dogs are brown&lt;/code&gt; as "the number of dogs is equal to the number of brown objects", then &lt;code&gt;equi&lt;/code&gt; would be nonconservative because the sentence above is different from &lt;code&gt;equi dogs are brown dogs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Interestingly, my conlang Jbl has nonconservative determiners; for instance, &lt;em&gt;glsh&lt;/em&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;equi&lt;/em&gt; mentioned above.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It's not strictly impossible to become a professional conlanger (obviously, since professional conlangers do exist), but it's highly unlikely. There are very, very few conlanging jobs out there, and at this point most who want to hire a conlanger will look for a known entity. Most of the professional conlangers you've heard of got their first conlanging job because they were very, very lucky and got any subsequent conlanging jobs because of their first one. So unless you know a surefire way to increase your luck or you happen to know people who work in showbiz already (nepotism never hurts), your odds of becoming a professional conlanger are not that great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the &lt;a href="https://conlang.org/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Language Creation Society&lt;/a&gt; does have a &lt;a href="http://jobs.conlang.org/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;job board&lt;/a&gt; where people looking for conlangers to hire can solicit someone -- it's usually empty, but it's really the only good place to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for prerequisites, there really aren't any besides being interested in conlanging (and ideally having done so before) and having the right connections to get someone to actually hire you. A background in linguistics will likely make you better at conlanging, but it's not necessarily going to be required for you to get hired.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;It's not strictly impossible to become a professional conlanger (obviously, since professional conlangers do exist), but it's highly unlikely. There are very, very few conlanging jobs out there, and at this point most who want to hire a conlanger will look for a known entity.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The list of ways to make money with a conlang is short, so step one is to be creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write Genre Fiction Books.&lt;/strong&gt;
Authors do make a living writing and selling books, sometimes with an artificial language bundled with it. Wardesan, Láadan, Tolkien's books are good examples. I'm guessing the conlang part though is reducing their income, they could write more books if they skipped writing a conlang. Personally, I'd buy a book with a conlang if the author tried to make it simple enough to enjoy for 10 to 20 hours. Instead we get unusable languages that require 2000 hours of study to appreciate them, same or worse than a natural language. And I'm an outlier, so I'd imagine regular genre fiction buyers see a bundled language as a low value gimmick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication Systems for the Disabled&lt;/strong&gt;.
Blissymbols made money, albeit in a rather dishonorable way by suing the institution that was trying to help the profoundly disabled communicate with a symbol board, which was in essence an artificial language. I spoke with a specialist in the more modern versions of these, and often vendors don't even bother to acknowledge that symbol boards are not English, but conlang-like systems with all the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the realm of conscripts, there is a commercial writing system for ASL. I'm failing to re-find the link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical BSL was essentially a franchise and BSL was something of a trade secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movies.&lt;/strong&gt;
Movies have been hiring professional linguists (Klingon, Na'vi) The Klingon dictionary and Avatar handbook sold a lot of copies, but the authors both became professional linguists first, and these books are really side projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selling learning materials.&lt;/strong&gt;
This has got to be the worst way to monetize a conlang. The artificial language section of any large library has to be littered with books of people who thought they could sell a lot of copies of their grammar summaries, workbooks and dictionaries. No one wants the grammar summary. What they want is to meet their significant other by learning a language which brings me to...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esperanto&lt;/strong&gt;
Esperanto actually has economic activity, but the language is already written. Building a language starts with grammar and vocabulary, but to extract money from people, people need to learn it. If your interest in conlang building is in the community building part, then it might make more sense to make a living working with an existing conlang that has attracted a community, complete with conferences, etc. That said, I'm guessing no one is getting rich off of Esperanto, but there are teachers of Esperanto, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games&lt;/strong&gt;
There have been reports of people writing full languages for computer games, card games. Magic the Gathering's Phyrexian comes to mind. So far, these have been gimmicks and the amount of money, I'm guessing is not a lot. Some of the game makers don't even bother to publish the grammar and dictionary! This makes it sort of into a laborious game of decipherment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Has Klingon changed significantly since it has started being used for Star Trek: Discovery? Has the vocabulary grown significantly? Has there been novel grammar revealed? To what extent is the language still developing under Marc Okrand's guidance to meet the demands of the script, and how much leeway does Robyn "Qov" Stewart have in coming up with Klingon translations for the script?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;The language still has Okrand's guidance, and he trusts Robyn to do it correctly.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.indiewire.com/2017/09/star-trek-discovery-klingon-language-translation-1201880882/3/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;IndieWire&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Before Stewart initially took the “Discovery” job, she did check in with Okrand himself to make sure he approved. “He said, ‘You know what? I’m really glad you’re doing this for two reasons: One is so I don’t have to do it.’ Because just for a movie, it’s a lot of work, and the series goes on,” Stewart said.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;But Okrand then added that he knew “the language is in good hands.” Said Stewart, “It was a huge ego boost for me — his confidence that I’ll do it correctly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even though Robyn Steward has Okrand's approval, every change has to get his stamp of approval before officially being added to the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://trekmovie.com/2017/10/01/watch-inventor-of-klingon-language-discusses-new-words-made-for-star-trek-discovery/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;TrekMovie&lt;/a&gt; tells us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As was noted in the video, Okrand isn’t working on Star Trek: Discovery, as the translating for the show is being handled by Klingon expert Robyn Stewart. However, Okrand is still the only person who can introduce new words into the Klingon language, which is maintained by the Klingon Language Institute. As he does at each annual conference of the KLI (called the qep’a’), Okrand introduced a number of new Klingon words in the summer of 2017. You can see the &lt;a href="https://www.kli.org/about-klingon/new-klingon-words/datemodified/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;full list at KLI.org&lt;/a&gt; (words noted as “qep’a’ 24” were announced this year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to address each question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Has Klingon changed significantly since it has started being used for Star Trek: Discovery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope - the people working on it are hardcore Klingon speakers, doing their utmost to keep everything accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Has the vocabulary grown significantly? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's grown - you can see exactly which words were added recently in the above link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Has there been novel grammar revealed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I am aware, and from what Google turns up, no. The grammar is still the same as it was - just words are being added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To what extent is the language still developing under Marc Okrand's guidance to meet the demands of the script, and how much leeway does Robyn "Qov" Stewart have in coming up with Klingon translations for the script?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the above quote from TrekMovie, Okrand still has control over the language - while Steward has some wiggle room like any other translation to any other language, she has to work with the language, only adding words when absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;h1&gt;The language still has Okrand's guidance, and he trusts Robyn to do it correctly.&lt;/h1&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The scripts of South Asia (i.e. the Indian subcontinent), e.g. Devanagari, and Southeast Asia, e.g. Thai, are almost all derived from the Brahmic script. They show gradual visual relationships and most of them are structurally similar. They are syllabaries with non-default vowels being denoted by diacritics and consonant clusters often forming complex ligatures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any constructed variant of this family of scripts that intentionally uses shapes found in the major European scripts (Roman, Cyrillic and Greek)? Preferably, it would be based upon the stems and loops of lowercase Roman letters. I think it’s impossible to achieve in a readable way, but maybe there is even a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface#Mimicry_typefaces" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;mimicry or "faux Latin" font&lt;/a&gt; for one of the existing scripts (e.g. Burmese or Malayalam) that would qualify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I have attached some roman letters in red to similar looking glyphs in the picture below. The imagined conscript would have a consistent set of letters and diacritics that looked much like roman ones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned by @Sparksbet the Leipzig-Jakarta list comes in very useful (especially if you use conworkshop as there's a lexibuild list for it). If you want something more comprehensive that has the basics that is actually useful I would try using &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zt7CtjzSL7If_BgRn8BnA9aclU3_7-N22T7qhZ3nElg/edit#gid=0" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this google sheet&lt;/a&gt; for the universal language dictionary. It already has words listed in categories to make things easier! Atlernatively the &lt;a href="https://www.globish.com/gng/GNGPromo/SidebarPromo/1500GlobishWords.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Globish list&lt;/a&gt; is a decent starting point, though it was not designed for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned by @Sparksbet the Leipzig-Jakarta list comes in very useful (especially if you use conworkshop as there's a lexibuild list for it). If you want something more comprehensive that has the basics that is actually useful I would try using &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zt7CtjzSL7If_BgRn8BnA9aclU3_7-N22T7qhZ3nElg/edit#gid=0" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this google sheet&lt;/a&gt; for the universal language dictionary. It already has words listed in categories to make things easier! Atlernatively the &lt;a href="https://www.globish.com/gng/GNGPromo/SidebarPromo/1500GlobishWords.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Globish list&lt;/a&gt; is a decent starting point, though it was not designed for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;If the speakers of the language are not your average humans of Earth, first make/find some texts that are suitable for the speakers: narratives, what happens during a regular, boring day, what happens in the market, at a restaurant, when traveling, making food, at the doctor's etc. Have a look at travel dictionaries for ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with very short texts, no more than a paragraph. (The following paragraph would work for many an ordinary human in the West in the current era:) "I get up in the morning. I have breakfast then leave for work. At midday I have lunch. I go home in the early evening. I have dinner with my family. Finally, I go to bed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then figure out how to do the most frequent words (you might have 'em all covered already. But which set you need will vary. If for instance, you don't want articles, make a DO NOT-wordlist: the word you don't want (like "the") followed by what you do instead. This is very handy for future translations.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the most frequent words, do the remaining nouns and verbs. Whether there are adjectives and adverbs and many other word classes will depend on the language, so wait a while with those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, pick one sentence and expand it to a paragraph: "I sleep alone in a bedroom. The bedroom has a floor, a ceiling, several walls, a bed, a window, a door, a light, and an alarm clock. The dog sometimes gets in during the night and also sleeps in my bed." Expand the other sentences in the first paragraph before you expand anything in the second paragraph. This will give you the words needed for daily life quite quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be wary of translating things that are the wrong tone and age at an early stage, like medieval tales or older if your speakers are of the modern era, or specific religious texts if your speakers don't do that religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you translate the Babel-text early you risk having a word for an outdated technique for joining bricks (and a word for non-fired bricks) before you have a term for "to eat", "to speak", "to go"...&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I remember some facts about an international auxiliary language (IAL) created by a Japanese person, but unfortunately I both forgot the name of the inventor and the name of the IAL. Can someone help me out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features that I can remember:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created by a Japanese around the turn of 19th to the 20th century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on European languages (mostly latinate vocabulary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a schematic and simplified inflection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the author became aware of Esperanto he dumped his own IAL project and became one of the first Japanese Esperantists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to know the name of the author and (if available) the name of the language. Additional information is always welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the OP misremembered a few facts, the language may be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Babm&lt;/a&gt;, invented by the Japanese philosopher Rikichi [Fuishiki] Okamoto (1885–1963) and first published in 1962. It uses the Latin script as a syllabary (which is not the same thing as using a latinate vocabulary) and has "some degree of analytic inflection".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Assume that the backstory of a conlang is that it developed from a set of other languages. In other words, speakers of these (different) languages were living in the same area and were communicating with each other and from this a new language emerged, a creole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such a situation which aspects of the original languages would be inherited by the new languages? Obviously the vocabulary would be somewhat mixed but what happens with the grammar? Would the easiest concepts prevail? Would it be necessary that one of the original languages would be dominant in some sense or could they have an equal influence?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Assume that a conlang is written partially with an alphabet and partially with pictograms. The idea is to have something like the Japanese writing system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it follows the structure of natlangs to have symbols for the words which are of particular cultural importance for the speakers of this language? Is there a common pattern or system for a categorisation of words which have their own symbols in most of the natlangs using such a mixed writing system, e.g. &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;woman&lt;/em&gt; etc?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The date that work began on the language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The date of the first evidence of work on the language, if the prior date is not known&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The date of the first usage of the language (this could be broken down into public &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; private usage)&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;For auxiliary languages it's usually publication date of the first grammar/dictionary released to the public or the first work dedicated to the language, whichever comes first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Esperanto this was &lt;em&gt;Unua Libro&lt;/em&gt;, which was published in 1887 - more than a year after Zamenhof began working on the language. Wikipedia also lists the year of creation of Occidental as 1922, the year de Wahl published the first edition of the &lt;em&gt;Kosmoglotta&lt;/em&gt; magazine, despite there being evidence that the language was used much before then, both in private conversation (letters etc.) and even a publication written entirely in Occidental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "date of creation" for other types of conlangs seems to be less well-defined, although I'd expect that fictional languages would be associated with the publication of the first book/movie/game that uses them (perhaps with the exception of Tolkien's languages). Wikipedia also uses the day Lojban began being developed as its creation date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I would think that it relates to the power structures behind the language communities, and to their relative size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be kind of observed with English after the Norman invasion. The basic English grammar still remained Anglo-Saxon (as the majority of the population spoke it), and the main influence of Norman French (the powerful but small elite) was in the vocabulary. There are a few instances (eg putting some specific adjectives after the noun, as in &lt;em&gt;president elect&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;times past&lt;/em&gt;) where French structures were adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would think that vocabulary is more a conscious choice, and Norman power made people adopt French words, but the grammatical structures being more sub-conscious meant that they were harder to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue is how closely related the origin languages are. Obviously, while Norman French and Old English are different families, they both share the Indo-European ancestry, so are not that radically different. Compare that to, eg the Philippines, where there is a great language variety, and Asian/Polynesian languages clashed with Spanish/English in the colonial period. Here is one creole, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chavacano" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Chavacano&lt;/a&gt;, which apparently has mostly Spanish vocabulary (so that it is classed as a Romance language), but &lt;em&gt;their grammatical structures are generally similar to other Philippine languages&lt;/em&gt; (Wikipedia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it seems that power drives the vocabulary, but quantity of speakers determines the grammar. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I've done stories and rhyming poems with my own JABBER.EXE, but it is 16 bit (windows XP or earlier).  Besides filling out a dictionary (which includes verb affordances and hyponym trees), you have to set 'parameters' for the language, and ConLangs do too much with those parameters.  There can be no general purpose ConLang generator unless it learns like a human. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The best I've found, for linguistic purposes, is &lt;a href="http://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/dgs-korpus/index.php/hamnosys-97.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;HamNoSys&lt;/a&gt; ("Hamburg Notation System", Hanke (2004)). It works like IPA: it is more an instruction-notation than observation-notation. For example; IPA allows glottal stop [ʔ] together with (i.e.) palatal, dental, alveolar and labial fricatives, but these are indistinguishable. Another example: [m͡n] (depending on notation, I'll use x͡y is simultaneously x and y) is [m] + [n] but sounds like plain [n].&lt;br&gt;
This concept continues on in HamNoSys: see &lt;a href="http://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/dgs-korpus/files/inhalt_pdf/HamNoSys_Handshapes.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this chart&lt;/a&gt;, where overlapping segments are indistinguishable but technically doable and thus notatable. According to Millar (2001), it is the most used notation, alongside Stokoe and derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, HamNoSys has programs that convert HamNoSys into imagery and videos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Many constructed writing systems are purportedly used to write conlangs, but in reality are actually used to write English or another natlang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/kryptonian.php" rel="noreferrer"&gt;omniglot.com says that Kryptonian&lt;/a&gt; is "a transliteration alphabet containing symbols for each of the letters of the English alphabet. ... They just used this alphabet to write things in English in the comics."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w1iM8.gif" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w1iM8.gif" alt="The Kryptonian alphabet"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bionicle.wikia.com/wiki/Matoran_Language" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Matoran has been called&lt;/a&gt; "similar to the English alphabet, being a simple substitution cipher".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in Star Wars, &lt;a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Aurebesh" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Aurebesh&lt;/a&gt; is essentially the same, a different way of writing English, although technically it's actually "Galactic Basic". Apparently another script was also used to write Galatic Basic, called &lt;a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Outer_Rim_Basic" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Outer Rim Basic&lt;/a&gt;, although there's very little information about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VJaSk.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VJaSk.png" alt="The Aurebesh alphabet"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd consider these example to be a different kind of thing compared to something like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Dancing_Men" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the dancing men script from Sherlock Holmes&lt;/a&gt; as they're ostensibly constructed writing systems for other languages, whereas the dancing men script is explicitly another way of writing English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the conlang community, is there a specific term for this type of constructed writing system? Or should we just refer to them as "transliterations" or "substitutions"?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that I am specifically asking if there is a term which excludes these categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new orthographies for natlangs (ex. Canadian Aboriginal syllabics or Deseret for English)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new writing system actually used to write a conlang (ex. Tengwar for Quenya)&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that, while this is not &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; what you're asking, &lt;strong&gt;Law French&lt;/strong&gt; I think it might be argued fits the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While French, of course, was the everyday language of the upper class in England from the mid-11th to the late 14th century, and was therefore naturally the language of the Law, it can hardly be called a "constructed language". But after this time, it might be said that, divorced of all real connexion with French or Anglo-French culture, Law French came to be something like an invented language &lt;em&gt;based on&lt;/em&gt; natural French. It was certainly a group project (lawyers and judges, all others need not apply).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later examples are both humorous and instructive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Richardson Chief Justice de Common Banc al assises de Salisbury in Summer 1631 fuit assault per prisoner la condemne pur felony, que puis son condemnation ject un brickbat a le dit justice, que narrowly mist, et pur ceo immediately fuit indictment drawn per Noy envers le prisoner et son dexter manus ampute et fix al gibbet, sur que luy mesme immediatement hange in presence de Court.  -- Sir George Treby&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Law French might best be called a &lt;em&gt;deconstructed&lt;/em&gt; language?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About all that's left in modern times are a few set phrases, mostly in Parliament:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La reyne (or le roy) remercie ses bons sujets, accepte leur benevolence, et ainsi le veult&lt;/em&gt; -- (The Queen/King thanks her/his good subjects, accepts their bounty, and wills it so)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La reyne (or le roy) le veult&lt;/em&gt; -- (The Queen/King wills it)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La reyne (or le roy) s'avisera&lt;/em&gt; -- (The Queen/King will advise)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soit fait comme il est désiré&lt;/em&gt; -- (Let it be done as it is desired)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the USA, we still hear &lt;em&gt;oyez, oyez, oyez&lt;/em&gt; when court comes to order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interesting notes on Law French, especially pertinent to the question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The effort of reporting English speech in French was not merely an expression of affection for the past, for in the long run it probably saved a lawyer more time and trouble than was taken to learn it. ... The formalised French phrases used in the year books gave him a shorthand ready made and adapted for legal purposes."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"To the linguist, Law French is a corrupt dialect by definition. Anglo-French was in steady decline after 1300. ... (That English lawyers could seriously complain that French, spoken in France, had deteriorated considerably as compared to its use in England) is in itself a clear demonstration that by the middle of the fifteenth century there was a marked difference between the French of English lawyers and the French of France."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Frenchman living in England during Elizabeth I's reign noted of Law French "...now it seemeth that almost there is no language more far from the true French, then the French of our lawes: There being almost no word, which either by intermingling, or adding, or diminishing, or changing of a letter into another, they have not altered and corrupted."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The lawyers also took what seemed to be a perverse delight in pronouncing Law French as if it were English: indeed, 'their pronunciation differeth so much from ours (French) as it is impossible for a Frenchman to understand them'.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Few of those who used French paid the slightest attention to grammar or vocabulary."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that, while this is not &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; what you're asking, &lt;strong&gt;Law French&lt;/strong&gt; I think it might be argued fits the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While French, of course, was the everyday language of the upper class in England from the mid-11th to the late 14th century, and was therefore naturally the language of the Law, it can hardly be called a "constructed language". But after this time, it might be said that, divorced of all real connexion with French or Anglo-French culture, Law French came to be something like an invented language &lt;em&gt;based on&lt;/em&gt; natural French. It was certainly a group project (lawyers and judges, all others need not apply).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later examples are both humorous and instructive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Richardson Chief Justice de Common Banc al assises de Salisbury in Summer 1631 fuit assault per prisoner la condemne pur felony, que puis son condemnation ject un brickbat a le dit justice, que narrowly mist, et pur ceo immediately fuit indictment drawn per Noy envers le prisoner et son dexter manus ampute et fix al gibbet, sur que luy mesme immediatement hange in presence de Court.  -- Sir George Treby&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Law French might best be called a &lt;em&gt;deconstructed&lt;/em&gt; language?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About all that's left in modern times are a few set phrases, mostly in Parliament:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La reyne (or le roy) remercie ses bons sujets, accepte leur benevolence, et ainsi le veult&lt;/em&gt; -- (The Queen/King thanks her/his good subjects, accepts their bounty, and wills it so)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La reyne (or le roy) le veult&lt;/em&gt; -- (The Queen/King wills it)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La reyne (or le roy) s'avisera&lt;/em&gt; -- (The Queen/King will advise)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soit fait comme il est désiré&lt;/em&gt; -- (Let it be done as it is desired)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the USA, we still hear &lt;em&gt;oyez, oyez, oyez&lt;/em&gt; when court comes to order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interesting notes on Law French, especially pertinent to the question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The effort of reporting English speech in French was not merely an expression of affection for the past, for in the long run it probably saved a lawyer more time and trouble than was taken to learn it. ... The formalised French phrases used in the year books gave him a shorthand ready made and adapted for legal purposes."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"To the linguist, Law French is a corrupt dialect by definition. Anglo-French was in steady decline after 1300. ... (That English lawyers could seriously complain that French, spoken in France, had deteriorated considerably as compared to its use in England) is in itself a clear demonstration that by the middle of the fifteenth century there was a marked difference between the French of English lawyers and the French of France."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Frenchman living in England during Elizabeth I's reign noted of Law French "...now it seemeth that almost there is no language more far from the true French, then the French of our lawes: There being almost no word, which either by intermingling, or adding, or diminishing, or changing of a letter into another, they have not altered and corrupted."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The lawyers also took what seemed to be a perverse delight in pronouncing Law French as if it were English: indeed, 'their pronunciation differeth so much from ours (French) as it is impossible for a Frenchman to understand them'.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Few of those who used French paid the slightest attention to grammar or vocabulary."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;I don't think there's already a word for this exact subset of scripts.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I think such a term would be a useful one -- we certainly have to refer to these sorts of scripts in the conlanging community -- and I think there are a number of options here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Circumlocution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could refer to these sorts of scripts in paraphrastic ways, like how you have in your question. "Transliteration alphabet" and "substitution cipher" both work for this purpose. However, I don't think this is a particularly attractive option, as these are long and rather unwieldy. Shortenings of these phrases end up being pretty ambiguous, as well. "Transliteration" in particular is usually used to describe completely separate things entirely, so using it in isolation to refer to these scripts would be confusing at best, and "substitution" is too vague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Neologism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these sorts of scripts are really the neographic equivalent of relexes, we could also coin a new term like "relex" to refer to these scripts. Just spitballing, here are a few examples of the sorts of coinages that could work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transbet (from "transliteration alphabet")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subscript (from "substitution script" -- though this word does obviously already have another meaning so that might not be desirable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rescript (from analogy with "relex")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keychain script (because these sorts of scripts are easily used to sell keychains with people's names on them 'in another language')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are any number of ways that such a term could be derived beyond these, but I feel that in order to have a term that describes this subset of scripts, &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; sort of new coinage is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Has anyone tried to put one of Tolkien's Elvish languages Sindarin or Quenya into everyday conversational use? I can imagine fan groups doing this, but I can also imagine big problems with the available vocabulary (and potentially also with the available grammar).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there documented events where Elvish was spoken conversationally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any additional information (e.g., on how to deal with the vocabulary) are also welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'd lower the criteria significantly and already admit that a conlang has a speech community when it is used on some occasions for real-time face-to-face communications. By these criteria, even Klingon has a speech community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether a speech community is functional or not is probably difficult to decide, I'd go for a kind of temporal criterion like having a speech community (as sketched above) for 30 years with no year left out. This is similar to the criterion biologists use to define an established new species in a certain area.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;It is not possible to speak Tolkien's Elvish Languages.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may confuse some people, considering how much nonsense there is online for "how to speak Tolkien's Elvish" (there's even &lt;a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Speak-Elvish" rel="noreferrer"&gt;a wikihow article&lt;/a&gt; about it). But according to the &lt;a href="http://www.elvish.org/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Elvish Linguistic Fellowship&lt;/a&gt;, an organization dedicated to the study of Tolkien's invented languages, even Quenya and Sindarin are simply not learnable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The vocabulary, grammar, and syntax of Tolkien's invented languages, even of Quenya and Sindarin, &lt;strong&gt;are far too incomplete to allow its casual, conversational, or quotidian use&lt;/strong&gt;. As Tolkien himself stated, "It should be obvious that if it is possible to compose fragments of verse in Quenya and Sindarin, those languages (and their relations one to another) must have reached a fairly high degree of organization — though of course, far from completeness, either in vocabulary, or in idiom" (Letters p. 380). Indeed, it was never Tolkien's intent to make Quenya, Sindarin, or any of his languages into spoken, written, auxiliary, or otherwise "useful" forms; rather, they were done for purely personal enjoyment. As Tolkien wrote, "It must be emphasized that this process of invention was/is a private enterprise undertaken to give pleasure to myself by giving expression to my personal linguistic 'aesthetic' or taste and its fluctuations" (ibid.)    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- &lt;a href="http://www.elvish.org/FAQ.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the aforementioned E.L.F.'s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, emphasis mine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An article entitled &lt;a href="http://www.elvish.org/articles/EASIS.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;"Elvish As She Is Spoke"&lt;/a&gt; goes into more depth about the history of Tolkien's Elvish and the problems with trying to learn to speak it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"But don't they speak Elvish in the films?"&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lines and lyrics from Tolkien's languages in the Peter Jackson films were written by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Salo" rel="noreferrer"&gt;David Salo&lt;/a&gt;, a linguist who wrote &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0874808006" rel="noreferrer"&gt;a grammar of Sindarin&lt;/a&gt;. He built the dialogue he needed on the limited available attested vocabulary, coining some new words himself but with the goal of making it intelligible to any viewers familiar with Tolkien's languages. &lt;a href="http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/movie_intro.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;To quote him&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why is there Elvish in the movie? Why did Peter Jackson care enough to strive for some accuracy in the way language is presented? (...) The Elvish in the movie is addressed to the minority of viewers who know something about the languages. And what are they going to want to do when they hear the Elvish sentences?  They're going to want to figure out what they mean, and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they mean what they mean. Part of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; intention, my particular vision and contribution to this movie, was to create sentences which would be intelligible to the people who study the languages (...) I'm enormously happy to see some people saying based on their knowledge of Elvish, great or small, that they recognized and understood some of what they heard on the screen. That's great - that's &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the kind of effect that I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href="http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/movie_elvish.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;a collection of the translated dialogue from the LoTR films&lt;/a&gt;, with the attested and unattested vocabulary in each line listed. As you can see, a lot of it is attested in Tolkien's works, but there is quite a bit that needed to be invented for the film by Salo. There have been other projects based on Tolkien's Elvish languages in the past as well, but the real fanatics tend to view these as "pseudo-Elvish", since anything not invented by Tolkien can't really be said to be part of Tolkien's Elvish. That said, there's nothing wrong with seeking out resources for and learning these expansions on Tolkien's conlangs -- just know that calling any one an authentic recreation of Tolkien's Elvish is pretty flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tl;dr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since Tolkien never fixed his languages firmly or described them completely enough to provide any such comprehensive and corrective model (that never being his goal), ... it is consequently a further inescapable fact that no one has or ever will be able to speak Quenya and Sindarin, any more than anyone will ever (again) be able to speak, say, Etruscan or any other fragmentarily-attested non-living language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There is already a conlang that kind of does that. In toki pona you can write the words in a set of pictograms (actually, there are several pictogrammatic writing systems, I'm referring here to the 'hieroglyphs' from the official book). As there are only 120 words, it's easy to have pictograms for all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem is what happens with &lt;strong&gt;other&lt;/strong&gt; words. Names, for example. The toki pona solution is to select a hieroglyph whose word starts with the respective sound. This leaves some choice, as you typically have several pictograms available and you can choose a word whose meaning is somewhat relevant to the name. For example, &lt;em&gt;Kanata&lt;/em&gt; (Canada) could start with the pictogram for &lt;em&gt;kasi&lt;/em&gt; ("plant, leaf"), to link to the maple leaf; &lt;em&gt;Nokisi&lt;/em&gt; (Norway) would start with &lt;em&gt;nena&lt;/em&gt; ("hill, mountain"), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you are using pictograms to &lt;strong&gt;spell&lt;/strong&gt; a word, but it is easily conceivable to have a separate script for names and foreign words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the vocabulary of your language is substantially larger than toki pona's 120 words, you might not want to use pictograms for everything. In this case you could use them either for 'core' words (whether you define them by meaning, age,  etymology or frequency), or it could be words that have no inflections (and thus don't change, eg function words like &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; in English).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end it's your choice how you solve this, but there are certainly some possible justifications for different choices that you could explore.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;There is already a conlang that kind of does that. In toki pona you can write the words in a set of pictograms (actually, there are several pictogrammatic writing systems, I'm referring here to the 'hieroglyphs' from the official book). As there are only 120 words, it's easy to have pictograms for all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem is what happens with &lt;strong&gt;other&lt;/strong&gt; words. Names, for example. The toki pona solution is to select a hieroglyph whose word starts with the respective sound. This leaves some choice, as you typically have several pictograms available and you can choose a word whose meaning is somewhat relevant to the name. For example, &lt;em&gt;Kanata&lt;/em&gt; (Canada) could start with the pictogram for &lt;em&gt;kasi&lt;/em&gt; ("plant, leaf"), to link to the maple leaf; &lt;em&gt;Nokisi&lt;/em&gt; (Norway) would start with &lt;em&gt;nena&lt;/em&gt; ("hill, mountain"), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One consideration is the source of the symbols themselves. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingir" rel="noreferrer"&gt;DINGIR&lt;/a&gt; had the syllabic value /an/ in Sumerian, but it also stood in for the word "god" because An was a Sumerian god. (And, one step further, DINGIR still meant "god" in Akkadian even though the Akkadian word for god was now &lt;em&gt;ilu&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Sinaitic_script" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Sinaitic inscriptions&lt;/a&gt; were written in an abjad, and yet (may have) used certain letters as the words that the letters were derived from: For instance, the glyph &lt;em&gt;ʾ&lt;/em&gt; may have stood for ox (* &lt;em&gt;ʾalp&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; may have stood for celebration (* &lt;em&gt;hillul&lt;/em&gt;), and &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; for head (* &lt;em&gt;raʾsh&lt;/em&gt;), because the pictures that originally formed those letters depicted an ox, celebration, and a head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if your script derives some of its symbols from pictures of something, the symbol could stand in for the word that the glyph depicts (or once depicted). This is a little circular when trying to determine which words should have their own symbols, but the point is that what determines which words have this status is often just an accident of history instead of a categorization of important words.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;For a conlang, it seems like one other way to avoid ambiguity that I do not see noted in previous answers is to have &lt;strong&gt;the language enforce grammatical rules&lt;/strong&gt; such that a pronoun must &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; refer to a specific type of referent. That is, consider these four possible types of grammar rules (they may be other rules a language may follow):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pronoun always refers to the last referent&lt;/strong&gt;, any mention of a prior referent must be renamed. So in your example, the grammar would remove the ambiguity as such a rule would refer to James in your original example:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help him with his writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if Adam was the intent, then it would need to be one of these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help Adam with his writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To James, Adam sent the essay to help him with his writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pronoun always refers to the far referent when two referents are in view&lt;/strong&gt;, and is left off when the near referent is intended. So of James getting help, no pronoun is used, and the sentence would roughly translate simply as:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help with writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of Adam, the pronoun would be used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help him with his writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pronoun always refers back to a subject&lt;/strong&gt;, never an object (which must be restated if intended). So of James:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help James with James's writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I suspect something like #2 for James might be stated as well; or the language would form such a statement to place the main player in the subject position in a passive construction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;James was sent an essay by Adam to help him with his writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Adam, it would be as you originally stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help him with his writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pronoun always refers back to an object&lt;/strong&gt;, never the subject (which is restated if intended). So of James it is as you already had:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help him with his writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for Adam, it might be this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Adam sent the essay to James to help Adam with his writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice in that previous example by restating "Adam" as the object of "to help," it then put Adam in the most recent object position and allows for the "his" to then refer to Adam (who was also the subject).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for some of these grammatical ways of reducing ambiguity, the sentence structure in the language becomes more important (which may or may not be desirable in the language one is constructing).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Write a text/narrative, small or big, in your starting language. Then as you go through it create each element that may arise which does not exist in your language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning it will be a painstaking process, but as you continue it will provide useful insight on exactly which words you need to add. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a general rule to remember&lt;/strong&gt; —&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything you create or use out of dire need, will be more difficult to lose track of. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In Toki Pona, the small word &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; has several meanings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the official book &lt;em&gt;Toki Pona: The Language of Good&lt;/em&gt;, it says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The particle &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; has three uses: (1) after a noun phrase to show who is being called or addressed, (2) before a verb to express a command or request, (3) after the subject (and replacing &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt;) to express a wish or desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is whether a sentence like ”my friend, come here” (using &lt;em&gt;jan pona mi&lt;/em&gt; 'my friend', &lt;em&gt;kama&lt;/em&gt; 'come', &lt;em&gt;ni&lt;/em&gt; 'here') should be &lt;em&gt;jan pona mi o, o kama ni&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;jan pona mi o kama ni&lt;/em&gt;. Or perhaps those phrases are both acceptable? In that case, are they used interchangeably, or are there different use cases or styles? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems there are Toki Pona speakers with different opinions on this. Who are they, and what are their arguments?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://wals.info/chapter/4" rel="noreferrer"&gt;World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS)&lt;/a&gt;, a large database of various world languages' structural properties gathered from descriptive materials like grammars, around a third of the surveyed languages have a voicing contrast in plosives but not fricatives, and another third have no voicing contrast in either plosives or fricatives. Based on this, it seems that by raw numbers you're &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; likely to have only voiceless fricatives than you are to have both voiced and voiceless fricatives. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are even languages with &lt;em&gt;no fricatives at all&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://menzerath.phonetik.uni-frankfurt.de/upsid_find.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;UPSID&lt;/a&gt; sample contains 31 of them, making 6.8% of the sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FUll output of my UPSID query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 'fricative' sounds do not occur in these languages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Querying for languages without voiced fricatives gives "These 222 languages are 49.22% of all languages in UPSID". So the absence of voiced fricatives is a quite common feature of natural languages.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Personally, I use (Xe)LaTeX, as well as a Perl6 script to convert a custom-made dictionary format into LaTeX markup. Don't really need anything else, other than the occasional pen and paper for jotting down ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also do everything on paper as Isoraķatheð does.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Voiced fricatives are actually rare, humans don't seem to like them for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you could also count languages that don't distinguish voicing at all, but many of these make some other distinction like aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some languages out there with phoneme inventories even smaller than what you're aiming for. Piraha and Rotokas come to mind. Creoles in general tend to have minimalistic phoneme inventories too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As in, [ñ] or [ñ̃]. It seems to me you can make a nasal sound more nasal, maybe by stressing your nose muscles or something in that sense. Does this exist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:
Apologies, I was thinking about &lt;em&gt;Nareal consonants&lt;/em&gt;, which do apparently exist. (see answer by me below, the other answers are also good.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Nasal consonants are not nasal because you use any "nose muscles", but because the nasal passage is open and air is passing through it as well as the mouth. To my knowledge, the nasal passage does not have different degrees of being open or closed, so there wouldn't be any way to make a nasal consonant &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; nasal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are definitely some sounds that are &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; nasal than standard nasal stops. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenasalized_consonant" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Prenasalized and poststopped consonants&lt;/a&gt;, where a nasal followed by a non-nasal stop is treated as a single consonant, exist and are phonemic in some languages. There are also &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denasalization" rel="noreferrer"&gt;denasal phones&lt;/a&gt;, in which the nasal passage is open and used as a resonant cavity but air does not flow out the nose (think of how someone sounds when they have a stuffy nose). While denasals are not phonemic in any natlang to my knowledge, they are sometimes allophonic or phonetically present in a language that is losing its nasals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Here are the top five best-known (see footnote 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lojban at &lt;a href="https://mw.lojban.org/papri" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;lojban.org&lt;/a&gt; is the better-known successor of Loglan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loglan at &lt;a href="http://loglan.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;loglan.org&lt;/a&gt; is based on formal logic and is to some extent not unlike a transcription of formal logic (see footnote 2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ithkuil at &lt;a href="http://ithkuil.net" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ithkuil.net&lt;/a&gt; is like the two above but is as compact as possible, allowing to read, write, say, and hear complex thoughts and ideas in a matter of seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ceqli at &lt;a href="http://ceqli.pbworks.com/w/page/5455970/FrontPage" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://ceqli.pbworks.com/w/page/5455970/FrontPage&lt;/a&gt; is originally inspired by Loglan but later a bit more naturalist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CycL at &lt;a href="http://www.cyc.com/documentation/ontologists-handbook/cyc-basics/syntax-cycl/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.cyc.com/documentation/ontologists-handbook/cyc-basics/syntax-cycl/&lt;/a&gt; is a lot like a programming language intended mainly for neural networks. It's more suitable for expressing knowledge than for communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these have Wikipedia articles under their name, except Ceqli (available on &lt;a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceqli" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dutch Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) to which you can go via the link given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnotes: 1) These languages (except Lojban and possibly Ithkuil) don't actively disambiguate &lt;em&gt;phonemic&lt;/em&gt; ambiguity. That's the difference between 'an app' and 'a nap'. It resulted in English &lt;em&gt;a nickname&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;em&gt;an ekename&lt;/em&gt;.
2) An example of formal logic, using prerequisite axioms &lt;code&gt;[PERSON(a) 'A is a person', HAVE_ALIENABLE(a, b) 'A has B alienably', HEAD(a) 'A is a head']&lt;/code&gt;, is &lt;code&gt;∀ x: PERSON(x) → (∃ y: HAVE_ALIENABLE(x, HEAD(y)))&lt;/code&gt; ('Everyone has a head', 'For every X, if X is a person, there exists some Y which X has alienably and which is a head').&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnotes: 1) These languages (except Lojban and possibly Ithkuil) don't actively disambiguate &lt;em&gt;phonemic&lt;/em&gt; ambiguity. That's the difference between 'an app' and 'a nap'. It resulted in English &lt;em&gt;a nickname&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;em&gt;an ekename&lt;/em&gt;.
2) An example of formal logic, using prerequisite axioms &lt;code&gt;[PERSON(a) 'A is a person', HAVE_ALIENABLE(a, b) 'A has B alienably', HEAD(a) 'A is a head']&lt;/code&gt;, is &lt;code&gt;∀ x: PERSON(x) → (∃ y: HAVE_ALIENABLE(x, HEAD(y)))&lt;/code&gt; ('Everyone has a head', 'For every X, if X is a person, there exists some Y which X has alienably and which is a head').&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Is there an Elvish word for squirrel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to my latest information from Helmut W. Pesch, Das große Elbisch-Buch, Bastei-Lübbe 2009, there is no such word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best try is the Quenya word &lt;em&gt;nornoyaulë&lt;/em&gt; (literally "oak cat", from &lt;em&gt;norno&lt;/em&gt; "oak" and &lt;em&gt;yaulë&lt;/em&gt; "cat", formed after a German dialectal word).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surface that things are written on. Runes were carved in trees and, as such, do not have curves. The Greek alphabet was written on tablets, and curved lines were possible. The Arabic alphabet was written quickly on papyrus. Also, some civilisations might prefer cursive script over others. Arabic letters differ whether they're isolated, at the beginning of a word, at the end or in the middle. So does your handwriting with the Roman script. But Arabic kept their cursive when the digital age came, and the Roman script got rid of it and created the same character.&lt;br&gt;
Os (runes), psi (Greek alphabet, but modernised on a computer, see footnote 1), šīn (Arabic script, isolated)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's call the ancestor A. The two daughter languages will be called B1 and B2. A could be a pictographic script, from which B1 devised a syllabary but B2 kept pictographs. Or A was an abjad (alphabet without vowels) and B1 became an alphabet whereas B2 stayed an abjad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although language is passed on from mother language to daughter language with diachronics, script &lt;em&gt;doesn't need to&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, you don't often see one script in the same language for three language-generations except in some cases like Latin (but Vulgar Latin wasn't really written much). Borrow a script from a neighbouring language. This is what I recommend doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnotes: 1) Ancient Greek part of the Rosetta stone. Greek characters in Unicode are in many fonts modernised, this is an example of typical Ancient Greek script.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I cannot speak for any other language creator, but I have done so as part of "worldbuilding" - for an alien world to have alien languages adds verisimilitude, and even if the language isn't actually heavily used, knowing how the language works and having a partial vocabulary lets me insert words from that language where there is no exact translation in English, or where the English would be a long circumlocution. As an example, one language I worked up has a word that means, literally, "a change in lighting that reveals new detail", but whose use has been extended to the metaphorical equivalent - and in one discussion in the associated story, after one character explained something to another, the second thanked the first - "That was a very useful &lt;em&gt;kurìshdàm&lt;/em&gt;; thank you."&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, Mandarin Chinese can be considered to be such a language - it treats every noun as a mass noun. Every noun requires a "measure word" for counting, like "bottle" in "four bottles of water" or "sheet" in "ten sheets of paper". Chinese has a considerable list of these (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_classifiers" rel="noreferrer"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_classifiers&lt;/a&gt;) but there's no particular reason that a language with only mass nouns would need to have so many classifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, Mandarin Chinese can be considered to be such a language - it treats every noun as a mass noun. Every noun requires a "measure word" for counting, like "bottle" in "four bottles of water" or "sheet" in "ten sheets of paper". Chinese has a considerable list of these (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_classifiers" rel="noreferrer"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_classifiers&lt;/a&gt;) but there's no particular reason that a language with only mass nouns would need to have so many classifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The most common one I can think of is &lt;em&gt;yahoo&lt;/em&gt;, which was the name for brutish humans in the language of the Houyhnhnms from Jonathan Swift’s &lt;em&gt;Gulliver’s Travels&lt;/em&gt;.  The words &lt;em&gt;Lilliputian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Brobdignagian&lt;/em&gt; have also entered the language from the same source, as have &lt;em&gt;big-endian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;little-endian&lt;/em&gt;, supposedly calques from the fictional Lilliputian language.  &lt;em&gt;Utopia&lt;/em&gt; is the endonym for the island nation of Thomas More’s novel, although it’s derived from Greek roots.  Several of the portmanteau words Lewis Caroll had his characters from Wonderland or his other fictional settings say have become real words, for example, &lt;em&gt;chortled&lt;/em&gt;.  These might be considered words from an invented dialect.  &lt;em&gt;Munchkin&lt;/em&gt;, from L. Frank Baum’s &lt;em&gt;The Wizard of Oz&lt;/em&gt;, has become both a dictionary word for a small person and a slang word for an immature powergamer.  (Arguably, &lt;em&gt;Oz&lt;/em&gt; has become a nickname for Australia.)  &lt;em&gt;Robot&lt;/em&gt; is another common word that might qualify: it was a trademark in the play &lt;em&gt;Rossum’s Universal Robots&lt;/em&gt;, derived from Czech roots.  None of these, however, were ever fleshed out into complete conlangs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another well-known example is &lt;em&gt;Idaho&lt;/em&gt;, a made-up name that was passed off as a word from some Native language that supposedly meant, “gem of the mountains” even though the Natives did not mine or cut gems.  As far as we know, a man named William Craig just invented it as a hoax.  This was originally proposed as a name for what is now Colorado, but voted down in Congress after a blistering speech by Senator Joseph Lane of Oregon, who said, “I do not believe it is an Indian word, [...] No Indian tribe in the nation has that word [...] It is a corruption certainly, a counterfeit, and ought not to be adopted.” No one has any idea where the word &lt;em&gt;Oregon&lt;/em&gt; comes from, either, but certainly not any language native to the Pacific Northwest, so it’s only fair that Lane relented in 1863 when the name was re-used for the entirely different territory that still bears it today. There are many other stories of made-up foreign-sounding names becoming official, including Plano, Texas, which does not really mean flatland in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I can’t think of a good example from Tolkien: &lt;em&gt;Hobbit&lt;/em&gt;, for example, has become a name for the extinct species &lt;em&gt;Homo Floresensis&lt;/em&gt;, but within the conceit of the novel, Tolkien used it as the translation from his conlang into English.  Hobbit is an obscure Old English word that had been used occasionally before.  Tolkien reveals in the appendix to &lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt; that it was an English calque for the actual endonym &lt;em&gt;Kuduk&lt;/em&gt; in his conlang, meaning Hole-Dweller. Similarly, most of the other words in Tolkien that sound exotic were revived from Old English as “translations” from his conlangs, along with the obsolete plural forms &lt;em&gt;elves&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dwarves&lt;/em&gt; that he personally brought back.  He might have a strong claim that the word &lt;em&gt;orc&lt;/em&gt; today brings to mind his &lt;em&gt;orch&lt;/em&gt;, translated from his conlangs into English as &lt;em&gt;orc&lt;/em&gt;, but which is nothing like the sea-monster named &lt;em&gt;Orc&lt;/em&gt; in the myth of Perseus and Andromeda, so the word should just be considered a homophone.  The most familiar words from his conlangs themselves, not translated into English, would be the inscription on the One Ring.  That is, unless you consider the English translations in the body of the text a conlang!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, the writers originally borrowed names from Western mythology, like Vulcan and Romulan, and later on, when they developed more serious conlangs for those species, came up with the justification that they didn’t really call themselves that in their own languages at all.  However, loghaD gives the example of &lt;em&gt;Qapla'&lt;/em&gt;, from Klingon, occasionally used by SF geeks to mean “Success!” in English, although it would not be familiar to most native speakers.  I’ve heard geeks drop words and phrases from many sources about as often, like &lt;em&gt;grok&lt;/em&gt; from Robert Heinlein’s Martian and &lt;em&gt;Bah-weep-graaaaagnah wheep nini bong&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Transformers: The Movie&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kryptonite&lt;/em&gt;, now used as a generic word for an Achilles’ heel, was retconned into the alien endonym &lt;em&gt;Krypton&lt;/em&gt;, a combination of the names of the Adam and Eve-figures of the alien species, Kryp and Tonn, plus the scientific suffix &lt;em&gt;-ite&lt;/em&gt;.  That it’s a homonym of a different chemical element in English is, in-universe, a coincidence.  This is of course from DC Comics’ &lt;em&gt;Superman&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murry Gell-Mann has said he took the word &lt;em&gt;quark&lt;/em&gt; from a nonsense poem in James Joyce’s &lt;em&gt;Finnegan’s Wake&lt;/em&gt;, where it could have meant many different things at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several other made-up words in science fiction that have become at least somewhat widely-known.  &lt;em&gt;Ansible&lt;/em&gt;, by Ursula K. LeGuin, has been borrowed by many other works of science fiction.  &lt;em&gt;Zeerust&lt;/em&gt;, from Douglas Adams’ &lt;em&gt;The Meaning of Laff&lt;/em&gt; (which gave geographic names joke definitions) is actually used by some writers, &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust" rel="noreferrer"&gt;particularly at TV Tropes&lt;/a&gt;, in the sense he gave it: the particular kind of datedness of something that tried to be futuristic way back when.  &lt;em&gt;Morlocks&lt;/em&gt;, from H.G. Wells’ &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt;, appears in some dictionaries as a generic term for feral people. At least one college gave freshmen an orientation course called “Finding your Patronus,” after the spell from &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s anybody’s guess where Biblical and other mythological names that have become dictionary words, such as &lt;em&gt;Eden&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;cherubic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Semitic&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;siren&lt;/em&gt;, came from, but one possibility is that some were made up from whole cloth at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you are an especially fundamentalist member of the Latter-Day Saints movement (not the same thing as a member of the FLDS!), you consider Joseph Smith’s Reformed Egyptian a conlang that gave us such words as &lt;em&gt;Deseret&lt;/em&gt;.  If any example I mentioned is from a scripture you believe to be literally true, I respect your religious freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One edge case: a &lt;em&gt;barbarian&lt;/em&gt; originally meant someone who didn’t speak Greek, and who sounded to the Greeks like he was saying “bar-bar-bar.”  There’s a joke like this in what might be considered a work of ancient SF, Aristophanes’ &lt;em&gt;The Birds&lt;/em&gt;, where a foreign god speaks only in nonsense syllables that the picaresque heroes pretend to translate, and although none of them became words, the calque &lt;em&gt;Cloudcuckooland&lt;/em&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of those are words in English, but you asked about loanwords from any conlang to any natural language.  Someone else brought up the conlang Esperanto, which now has native speakers (although I’m not aware of any loanwords from Esperanto in natural languages other than the name of the language itself).  Some other answers on this site have suggested that Classical Sanskrit or Modern Hebrew might be considered conlangs of a sort, which in the process of turning a natural language into a literary language more like what its compilers wanted it to be, created a new one.  One might then bring several others up, such as Old Church Slavonic, Indonesian, Katharevousa, Guarani or Bokmål, although I certainly do not have the expertise to debate how to classify any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Difficult question. I think regularity would speed up learning, as children during language learning overgeneralise (see experiments with English past tense endings). Thus instead of learning the correct exceptions at a later stage the corresponding feature would have been learned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a programme for teaching &lt;a href="http://www.esperantoresearch.org.uk/site/book/files" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Esperanto as a first foreign language&lt;/a&gt;, as it can be used to increase second language awareness and is supposed to make learning a natural foreign language easier. You don't have to worry about exceptions, for one thing, so you can teach the concept without having to hedge your explanations by listing all the cases where it's different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal view on 'difficulty' of different languages is that all languages are about equally difficult. Some languages are easier/simpler regarding some features (English inflectional morphology), but make up for that in others (vast number of near-synonyms with different distributional characteristics in English). Toki Pona is a very simple language (120 words, virtually no syntactic complexity), so you can learn it almost in a day, but it is very hard to express complicated narratives, and an equivalent text in a more complex language would be far more concise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning Esperanto is reasonably easy, but then you look at how people actually use it in everyday interactions, and you find that it is more difficult than you imagined: there are a lot of the smaller particles that make it tricky to understand for a beginner. But the 'early' sentences composed when the language was still fairly new are a lot simpler. However, they were not suitable for encoding all the pragmatic and other information people need for an everyday language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there are undoubtedly features that make it easier for children to learn a language as L1, but the question is "what for?" It's a bit like learning Lisp programming: understanding the syntax takes literally ten minutes, but that does not mean you can write useful programs in it after that. Languages are more than the sum of syntax and vocabulary, and if there was a language that was easier to learn and use than other languages, and had equal expressive power, then we would all be speaking it already.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Mark Shoulson revived the proposal to encode Klingon in Unicode, in a 2016 document called “&lt;a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16329-piqad-returns.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pIqaD (Klingon) and its Usage.&lt;/a&gt;”  In it, he gives several examples, including a comic book, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: [Manifest Destiny] #1&lt;/em&gt;, translated into Klingon and printed almost entirely in &lt;em&gt;pIqaD&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent example I’ve seen of someone using &lt;em&gt;pIqaD&lt;/em&gt; in a context that has nothing to do with &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; is that some fans of the pro soccer player Meghan Klingenberg, of the Portland Thorns, bring this banner to all her home games in Portland, Oregon (photo by Molly Blue):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DCQcO.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DCQcO.jpg" alt="tlhIngebrgh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Klingon Wiki has a &lt;a href="http://www.klingonwiki.net/En/Fonts" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;list of fonts that support Klingon&lt;/a&gt;, including several that encode it in the region of the Private Use Area standardized by the Linux Kernel, and later, the &lt;a href="http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ConScript Unicode Registry&lt;/a&gt; and adopted by the Klingon Language Instutute.  There are, additionally, several TeX packages not listed there that support Klingon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The font downloads and some other support files are on &lt;a href="https://hol.kag.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, although you might not necessarily want to install the registry entries,  It’s usable; I got this image in LuaLaTeX with the KAG pIqaD font, complete with kerning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Im8ez.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Im8ez.png" alt="pIqaD"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the same template with the font Klingon pIqaD vaHbo’ by Mike Neft:&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;Mark Shoulson revived the proposal to encode Klingon in Unicode, in a 2016 document called “&lt;a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16329-piqad-returns.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pIqaD (Klingon) and its Usage.&lt;/a&gt;”  In it, he gives several examples, including a comic book, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: [Manifest Destiny] #1&lt;/em&gt;, translated into Klingon and printed almost entirely in &lt;em&gt;pIqaD&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent example I’ve seen of someone using &lt;em&gt;pIqaD&lt;/em&gt; in a context that has nothing to do with &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; is that some fans of the pro soccer player Meghan Klingenberg, of the Portland Thorns, bring this banner to all her home games in Portland, Oregon (photo by Molly Blue):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DCQcO.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DCQcO.jpg" alt="tlhIngebrgh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Klingon Wiki has a &lt;a href="http://www.klingonwiki.net/En/Fonts" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;list of fonts that support Klingon&lt;/a&gt;, including several that encode it in the region of the Private Use Area standardized by the Linux Kernel, and later, the &lt;a href="http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ConScript Unicode Registry&lt;/a&gt; and adopted by the Klingon Language Instutute.  There are, additionally, several TeX packages not listed there that support Klingon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The font downloads and some other support files are on &lt;a href="https://hol.kag.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, although you might not necessarily want to install the registry entries,  It’s usable; I got this image in LuaLaTeX with the KAG pIqaD font, complete with kerning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Im8ez.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Im8ez.png" alt="pIqaD"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the same template with the font Klingon pIqaD vaHbo’ by Mike Neft:&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I have noticed some artifacts from Russian in published earlier manuscripts of Tolkiens works, e.g.,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The figure named &lt;em&gt;Beorn&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; was named &lt;em&gt;Medwed&lt;/em&gt; in earlier manuscripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Early Quenya, there is the word &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2001931771.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;velike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; "great"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the influence of Russian to Tolkien's languages? &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;To begin with, Tolkien writes in letter 142 that &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I love music but have no aptitude for it [...] Slavonic languages are for me almost in the same category. I have had a go at many tongues in my time, but I am in no ordinary sense a 'linguist'; and the time I once spent on trying to learn Serbian and Russian have left me with no practical results, only a strong impression of the structure and word-aesthetic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which implies that large portions of his languages are probably not structured on Russian. I then further point to &lt;a href="http://lingwe.blogspot.com/2009/10/slavic-echoes-in-tolkien-response.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this essay&lt;/a&gt;. In summary, the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;conclusion that Tolkien “consciously or unconsciously achieved a literary effect in terms of Slavic culture through the prism of the Germanic”, goes too far on too little evidence [...] Better would be to say that Tolkien did indeed incorporate a few Slavic elements into the multifaceted and multi-sourced structure and background of Middle-earth, but that he did so quite sparingly and, in almost every case, only at its furthest margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the detailed analysis can be found in that article, it seems fairly clear that while a few words may have crept in here and there, these words were also Germanic cognates or were cut out of Tolkien's language, with only one or two exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I recall some years ago, someone submitted a greeting for Conlangery that was a bunch of insect sounds. According to the conlanger it is meaningful, though I don’t vet greetings too thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in my earliest conlang, Yeltax, there is a harmonic tone, with two simultaneous pitches. It’s impossible for humans to produce in normal speech, as the aliens who speak Yeltax have a syrinx, which makes two base frequencies possible. (Note: I made that before I learned any phonetics, and now I think I’d want to think about the acoustics here to distinguish this from the harmonics we use for vowels.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, though, most conlangers don’t make up too many sounds. Many of the gaps in the IPA chart are physically impossible, and it’s questionable that we’ve missed a major articulator. I think most of the true inventions will be for non-human languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving behind sound, though, it could be said that Rikchik has a robust alien phonetics that was invented from scratch. Since the aliens have many tentacles for signing, and a very non humanoid appearance, their signs can’t be related to any of the features of signs in human sign languages. Once again, invented phonetics is probably going to be for aliens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Old Entish&lt;/strong&gt; is a possibility, though not really by direct attestation. The Professor says of Old Entish that it is &lt;em&gt;"...slow, sonorous, agglomerated, repetitive, indeed long-winded; formed of a multiplicity of vowel-shades and distinctions of tone and quantity which even the loremasters of the Eldar had not attempted to represent in writing"&lt;/em&gt; (LotR Appendix F)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is after all spoken by Ents and Huorns (sentient tree-like beings). Lots of deep, rolling hoomhomming and baruurundillanding, possibly with subsonic undertones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;Qapla'&lt;/em&gt; ("success") is listed as an English word &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Qapla%27" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;on Wiktionary&lt;/a&gt;, which in essence means that it is regarded as an English loanword from Klingon. It has sparked &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:Qapla%27#March_2009" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;some debate&lt;/a&gt;, but it has survived Wiktionary's verification process twice (once in 2007 and again in 2008), even after &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion#Fictional_universes" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a specific policy limiting words from fictional universes&lt;/a&gt; was instituted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the Klingon insult &lt;em&gt;petaQ&lt;/em&gt; may also attain a similar status at some point. Although hardly commonplace, I've seen people use it in social media, without reference to Klingons or Star Trek, and as a part of otherwise English sentences (rather than just as an isolated phrase, as is usually the case with &lt;em&gt;Qapla'&lt;/em&gt;). They usually spell it differently, however, with variations including &lt;em&gt;p'tak&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p'takh&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;patak&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p'tok&lt;/em&gt; and others.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Esperanto is by design based on European languages, so every similarity to European languages is in fact intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to know how &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/355/what-are-the-defining-traits-of-a-euro-centric-conlang/356#356"&gt;Standard Average European (SAE criteria listed by @Sparksbet)&lt;/a&gt; Esperanto is. One of the hallmarks of SAE, the &lt;em&gt;have-perfect&lt;/em&gt;, is absent from Esperanto, and some criteria are formulated in a way that I feel not able to evaluate them. Has someone undertaken this already, or can do it on-the-fly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/23162/are-there-natural-languages-with-the-following-properties-seen-in-esperanto"&gt;this combination of features in Esperanto&lt;/a&gt; that is not matched by SAE languages but by central Semitic languages and Welsh.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Nick has talked about how there is no “slang” per se in Belter. Languages like French are spoken both on the street and in high society, so there are multiple registers. It’s an introductory language for many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slang is often used to exclude; if you’re not “one of us” but you still
Speak the language, you still are on the outside because you can’t quite follow what’s being said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A language like Quechua in South America (according to Nick) doesn’t develop slang because speaking it is already a marker for being low-status socially (vs Spanish speakers). Speaking Quechua already excludes those on the other end of the linguistic divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belter is similar. Nobody but Belters speak it (maybe some inner intelligence officers do, the way UK troops would learn Irish during the troubles. Speaking Belter is a mark of low social status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick has said that he would imagine belters “fluidly speaking belt Lish. One can code shift on the fly between the two languages quite easily. If there amongst a bunch a rock hopper’s, they’ll probably all speak pure LB. When they’re on the docks, when there are more inners around, probably shift more towards English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belters have to speak English to deal with the UN/MCRN tax
Collectors. When they get boarded by Mickie Marines, you BETTER speak English. When they deal with the any government office, it’ll be in English. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Haiti, the majority of the population are monolingual Kreyol speakers. But the language of Education and government forms is French. That leads to some fucked-up outcomes. I imagine Belter would be treated like Creole languages usually are; something broken &amp; degenerate, not a real language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The correspondence courses Naomi took were almost certainly in English. Nobody is translating engineering textbooks into a “degenerate” language like a Creole, and nobody is teaching this classs in LB. Hinikirii Brown’s tablet on Anderson Station was in English, although he father spoke to her mostly in LB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller is a perfect example of code shifting. Watch his hands throughout the seasons; for a “welwala”, he is the most hand-gesturing Belter on Ceres. When interviewing Gia (who has just had a client murdered in her room), he interviews her in LB to set her at ease. But when talking to the Governor’s agent about the water thieves, he speaks perfect English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prax is an educated Belter. You don’t do botany classes in LB. and when he wakes up on the refugee ship, he first asks for Mei in English. When he realizes the crewman he’s speaking to is a Belter, Prax switches to LB. Prax spends so much time speaking English, shifting back into LB is something that takes a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, my feeling is the code shift mainly comes from “am I speaking to a Belter, or an Inner?” The inner/Belter dichotomy is cooked into LB down to the level of pronouns the way social hierarchy is cooked into Japanese. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beltalowda” is the plural pronoun for “Belters” with the connotation of both “all Belters” as well as “us Belters” ( becaus again, almost nobody outside Belters speaks LB). “Inyalowda” is both “all inners” [No distinction between Earther or Martian], and “You inners”.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Although one of the "o"s is usually dropped, you don't have to, especially if it adds a certain emphasis to something or has some poetic value in a song etc, or maybe if you're calling someone first, making sure they're listening, then continuing. It's just not often done. So for general purposes, yes, drop an "o".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Esperanto shares a number of similarities with Standard Average European and is definitely Eurocentric.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Eurocentricism is definitely non-existent in Esperanto, and two are questionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;✱ Definite and Indefinite Articles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto uses a definite article la for definite nouns and uses no article for indefinite nouns. This is like some West Germanic languages (but only in the plural), Icelandic, Faroese and (Ancient) Greek. This doesn't fit the SAE exactly, which states that there is an indefinite article alongside the definite article. Nevertheless, it is also missing in quite] a few European languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;✓ Post-Nominal Relative Clauses with Resumptive Pronouns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto has post-nominal relative clauses and allows resumptive pronouns (verification needed). The latter part may be because of a Eurocentricism on Zamenhof's part he didn't notice. This fits the SAE standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;✕ 'To have' Perfect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto uses &lt;em&gt;esti&lt;/em&gt; 'to be' where European languages use 'to have'. Active-passive is indicated with the participle, cf. &lt;em&gt;mi estas vidi&lt;strong&gt;n&lt;/strong&gt;ta&lt;/em&gt; 'I have seen' and &lt;em&gt;mi estas vidita&lt;/em&gt; 'I have been seen'. This doesn't fit the SAE but isn't completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;✓ Nominative Experiencer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto is nom.-acc. and uses nom. for A and E, whereas for P acc. is used.This fits the SAE standard.
Esperanto prefers 'standard' verbs like 'I like it' over a bit more complicated constructions like 'it satisfies me'. This fits the SAE standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;✱ Active-Passive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said above, passive is formed with 'to be'. But so is the active. The difference isn't the verb 'to be'-'to have', but the participle (specifically, whether the participle has &lt;em&gt;-ta&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;-nta&lt;/em&gt;). This literally &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; fit the SAE but doesn't act like the SAE languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;✓ Anticausative Preference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preferences are up to the speakers. I'm not a speaker but I'd say there is a preference for anticausatives over causatives, especially since many Esperanto speakers are European and copy their preferences to Esperanto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;✓ Dative External Possession&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto uses dative external possession, especially in translations where another language, with dative external possession, is translated to Esperanto. This fits the SAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;✓ Comparative particle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto uses the particle &lt;em&gt;ol&lt;/em&gt; 'than' for comparatives. &lt;em&gt;Ol&lt;/em&gt; comes from German &lt;em&gt;als&lt;/em&gt; 'than', also a comparative particle. This fits SAE perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;✓ Relative Clause Based Equative Construction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto uses &lt;em&gt;tiel ... kiel&lt;/em&gt; for 'as ... as' relative-clause based equative constructions. Literally, that is 'so (in that manner) ... how/as (relatively used: in what manner, in which manner)'. This fits SAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;✓ Reflexive and Intensifier Pronoun&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto doesn't have a form like the English 'himself' and uses &lt;em&gt;mem&lt;/em&gt; 'self'. This is the root of 'himself'. &lt;em&gt;Lin mem&lt;/em&gt; 'himself' is literally 'him self'. The reflexive is different, Esperanto uses &lt;em&gt;si&lt;/em&gt;. This fits SAE standards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are two questions (with answers) on the Esperanto stackexchange dealing with this problem (and yes, it is perceived as a problem even among Esperanto speakers):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/4812/double-letters-in-esperanto"&gt;Double letters in Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/3626/are-double-consonants-pronounced-distinctively-from-single-consonants-in-esperan"&gt;Asking specifically about Finnlando&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is: The double letter should be pronounced differently from the single letter, and it should be a true double consonant (not just a long consonant). &lt;em&gt;Finnlando&lt;/em&gt; becomes hard to pronounce by these rules, and Esperantists are in fact shifting to the word &lt;em&gt;Suomio&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are several factors in a writing system that can be subject to change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The style of writing&lt;/em&gt;: In fact, style is ever-changing in human culture, and we see new styles every generation. Old styles may be revived, or the new styles become divergent enough to be considered a new writing system. Note that handwriting from a century ago (e.g., in Germany) is already very hard to read for the current generation and special training is needed to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The set of symbols used for writing&lt;/em&gt;: Some symbols may fall out of use, others are newly introduced (either by borrowing (Greek Y and Z into Latin Y and Z), or by modification of existing symbols (Latin V splitting up into U, V, W), or by new invention "out of nothing" (Emoji).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The use of diacritical marks&lt;/em&gt;: The writing system may be borrowed from another language and is not a perfect fit for the new language. Some devices are needed to accommodate the sounds of the new language to the writing system, like digraphs (e.g, English &lt;em&gt;sh&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;ch&lt;/em&gt;), diacritical marks, additional letters, or a combination of any of the former.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the introduced changes create a new writing system or just a variant of an existing writing system is merely a question of definition. I remember a heated debate on the Unicode mailing list whether Hebrew and Phoenician are one or two writing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I want to create a fantasy world with Elves speaking their own language. In order to avoid unwanted associations with works of other authors, the Elves should speak a newly invented language. What features make a conlang sound "Elvish" in a fantasy setting, delineating it from languages of other races (like humans, dwarves, or orcs)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My picture of Elves is heavily influenced by the works of Tolkien. The Elves are tall and strong humanoids with very long live-span living in the forests of my fantasy world. They are fond of arts and crafts and of poetry, but also engage in fights and wars when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elves like these are a common race in genre fiction by many authors, and they also occur in genre based games (e.g., Dungeons and Dragons). They often have typical Elvish names, and some authors also invented some bits of Elvish languages for them. So I assume there are some common features for Elvish languages. What are they?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The advantage of just leaving two o's is that you have one fewer rule to make people learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merging o's might sound better especially if o o is something that sounds wrong in your mother tongue. Sandhi, the rules for pronouncing and changing pronunciations of words at barriers is undefined in toki pona- no one with any clout ever definitively said anything one way or the other. Instead, we will get people doing what they do in their native language.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One way to look at "elvish" features is to compare how different elvish languages look, and to take inspiration from that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A look at the phonologies of a few elvish languages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quenya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(phonology from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya#Phonology" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;         Labial Alveolar Palatal Velar Glottal
Nasal        m       n              ŋ
Stop       p b     t d            k g
Fricative  f v     s     (ç)      x     h
Trill                r
Semivowel (ʍ) w             j
Liquid               l

      Front Central Back
Close  i(ː)         u(ː)
C-Mid  eː           o:
O-Mid  ɛ            ɔ
Open         a(ː)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sindarin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(phonology from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin#Phonology" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;         Labial  Dental Alveolar Lateral Palatal Velar Uvular Glottal
Nasal        m       n                              ŋ
Stop       p b     t d                            k g
Fricative  f v     θ ð   s       ɬ                      χ      h
Trill               r
Approximant                          l       j    ʍ w

        Front Central Back
Close   i y             u
Near-C  ɪ               ʊ
O-Mid   ɛ               ɔ
Open          a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some common denominators in Tolkien's Elvish: They all have distinction between voiced and unvoiced stops and (labial) fricatives, both have the somewhat /ʍ/ as a phoneme or allophone as well as /ŋ/, /x~χ/ and /h/. With vowels, they each have four vowel heights but nothing much in common beyond that. Allowed syllables seem to be (CC)V(CC) in Quenya (many more details at Wikipedia) and (C)V(C) in Sindarin, though I don't see that explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pathfinder Elf Names&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(names from &lt;a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedRaceGuide/coreRaces/elves.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Male Names: Caladrel, Heldalel, Lanliss, Meirdrarel, Seldlon, Talathel, Variel, Zordlon.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Female Names: Amrunelara, Dardlara, Faunra, Jathal, Merisiel, Oparal, Soumral, Tessara, Yalandlara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interpretation of the names hints at some of these features: Only two nasals, voicing distinction, five vowels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowed syllables: Apparently (C)V(CC) or (C)V(LC) where L is a liquid (l or r) or nasal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Elf Names&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(names from 3.5 edition Player's Handbook p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Male Names: Aramil, Aust, Enialis, Heian, Himo, Ivellios, Laucian, Quarion, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Female Names: Anastrianna, Antinua, Drusilia, Felosial, Ielenia, Lia, Mialee, Qilathe, Silaqui, Vadanja, Valanthe, Xanaphia&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Family Names: Amastacia, Amakiir, Galanodel, Holimion, Liadon, Meliamne, Naïlo, Siannodel, Ilphukiir, Xiloscient&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we seem to have gemination at the end of words, vowel length, maybe uvular stop; th and ph are &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; fricatives and not aspirated, judging by the presence of v and absence of f. Syllables seem to be (C)V(CC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the very questionable methodology of taking the least common denominators of all of them would give us something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;          Labial   Dental Alveolar Palatal Velar Glottal

Fricative  f v     θ       s z                    h
Trill                        r
Approximant                  l       j       w

        Front Central Back
Close   i               u
Mid     e               o
Open          a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want an elvish language to be easily recognizable as elvish, you might be able to copy some of these features. I'm not sure, though, that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; any feature that might be universally understood as elf-like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Children learning an L1 have most of the same challenges as people in general learning an L2. Children learning a conlang, will have all of the problems of children learning a non-community language from a parent-- mostly problems of exposure. Kids need to hear the language for something like 20+ hours a week, less than that and they start to learn a pidgin form that is simplified. See the literature on language death for more about that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A rich vocabulary is hard&lt;/strong&gt;. Teachers of languages say that the shear amount of vocabulary you need to learn is a major barrier to learning a language. This is why auxlangs try to pick words that are highly similar to what someone already knows. toki pona takes the idea of vocabulary reduction to about as far as it can go, but in my experience with it, it still feels like you need to memorize about 3000 set phrases whose meaning can't easily be guessed from the parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morphology is hard&lt;/strong&gt;. Analytic languages are going to be less difficult. In communities where a polysynthetic language is dying, the kids start using it as if it were analytic, i.e. with sentences with more words instead of one spectacularly complex verb. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lexicalized grammar is hard&lt;/strong&gt;. This is when you make up words instead of applying a grammatical rule. For example, in German, you have to just memorize most plurals as a second word. It is easy to accidentally create lexicalizations if you mother tongue has them. For example, in some language antonyms are phrasal or morphological modifications of a base word, in English and other languages, antonyms often are a separate word. My son right now is at the point where he over-regularized past tense English verbs, an indication that lexical past tense forms, (see, saw, eat, ate, etc) are hard, even for kids.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Tl;dr: Esperanto possesses about 8/12 SAE features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's go through these features one by one. This is going to be pretty long, sorry for that. For reference, I'm using the famous &lt;a href="http://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/seminar/abteilungen/sprachwissenschaft/ls_kortmann/Courses/Kortmann/Variation/index_html/2008-05-27.8724094854" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Haspelmath paper&lt;/a&gt; as reference for which features define the SAE sprachbund, as I did in &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/355/what-are-the-defining-traits-of-a-euro-centric-conlang/356#356"&gt;my earlier post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Definite and indefinite articles - ✗&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto defies SAE norms out the gate here, as it &lt;strong&gt;only has a definite article&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;libro&lt;/em&gt; - "a book"&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;la libro&lt;/em&gt; - "the book"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually quite bizarre, as those SAE languages that do not fit this criterion (such as Slavic languages, which heavily influenced Esperanto) have no articles at all. However, some neighboring non-SAE languages do have only a definite article, so this isn't too bizarre cross-linguistically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Relative clauses with relative pronouns - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haspelmath characterizes this way of forming relative clauses, unique to SAE languages, by the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The relative clause is post-nominal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an inflecting relative pronoun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This pronoun introduces the relative clause&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The relative pronoun functions as a resumptive, signalling the head's role in the relative clause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto relative clauses &lt;strong&gt;fit all of these criteria&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiu blua balono, &lt;strong&gt;kion&lt;/strong&gt; mi estis tenanta, knalis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  "That blue balloon, which I was holding, popped."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the relative clause &lt;em&gt;kion mi estis tenanta&lt;/em&gt; follows the nominal head &lt;em&gt;balono&lt;/em&gt;. It is introduced by an inflecting relative pronoun &lt;em&gt;kion&lt;/em&gt;, which is inflected for the accusative case to mark the balloon's role in the clause (that it is the object of &lt;em&gt;estas tenanta&lt;/em&gt;. Pretty much prototypical SAE here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. 'Have'-perfect - ✗&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many European languages used a form of "to have" plus a passive participle to mark what we can loosely call the perfect. The languages that possess this construction have grammaticalized it to different degrees, but according to Haspelmath, "what is important here is that they all must have had basically the same meaning when they were first created."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto &lt;strong&gt;does not have a 'have'-perfect&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, Esperanto emulates Slavic and Finno-Ugric languages in using "to be" + an active participle -- a form Haspelmath explicitly contrasts with the 'have'-perfect in his article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi estas vidinta la viron.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mi est-as vid-i-nta          la  vir-on
I  be-PRS see-PERF-ACT.PTCP  the man-ACC
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"I have seen the man."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprising given Zamenhof's language background, but not SAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Nominative experiencers - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With "verbs of sensation, emotion, cognition, and perception," there are two main strategies for expressing the experiencer -- either the experiencer is treated like an agent and marked as a nominative subject (e.g., "I like it"), or it is treated like a patient or goal and the stimulus is marked as a nominative subject (e.g., "It pleases me", "It is pleasing to me"). English pretty much exclusively uses nominative experiencers, but this isn't strictly binary across languages -- many languages, including quite a few SAE languages, will have some verbs that do the former and some that do the latter. However, most SAE languages have a very strong tendency to prefer nominative experiencers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto &lt;strong&gt;primarily uses nominative experiencers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi vidis fantomon.&lt;/em&gt; - "I saw a ghost."&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi timas la mallumon.&lt;/em&gt; - "I fear the darkness."&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi flaras florojn.&lt;/em&gt; - "I smell flowers."&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto does possess at least one verb that bucks the trend, &lt;em&gt;plaĉi&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ĉokolado plaĉas al mi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  "I like chocolate" (lit., "Chocolate is pleasing to me.")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even this construction is gradually becoming less used over time as speakers favor the nominative experiencer verb &lt;em&gt;ŝati&lt;/em&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi ŝatas ĉokoladon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  "I like chocolate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I think it's safe to say that Esperanto is pretty SAE in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Participial passive - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Haspelmath: "Standard Average European languages typically have a canonical passive construction formed with a passive participle plus an intransitive copula-like verb ("be", "become", or the like). In this passive the original direct object becomes the subject and the original subject may be omitted, but it may also be expressed as an adverbial agent phrase." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esperanto passives behave pretty much exactly in this way.&lt;/strong&gt; Unsurprising, since none of the language families from which it draws its inspiration differ from the SAE trend here either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La knabo estas batita (de sia fratino).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;la  knab-o  est-as bat-i-ta           de si-a      frat-in-o
the boy-NOM be-PRS hit-PERF-PASS.PTCP of REFL-POSS brother-FEM-NOM
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"The boy is hit (by his sister)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, these passive participle constructions in Esperanto can often be avoided using anticausitive morphology or free word order in contexts where this type of passive construction would be unavoidable in, say, English. But this construction exists and is certainly frequently used enough to be considered a nicely SAE feature of Esperanto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6. Anticausative prominence - ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto possesses both a causative affix &lt;em&gt;-ig&lt;/em&gt; and an anticausative affix &lt;em&gt;-iĝ&lt;/em&gt;, both of which are used very frequently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fand-i           fand-iĝ-i          brul-i             brul-ig-i
melt-INF         melt-ANTIC-INF     burn-INF           burn-CAUS-INF
"to melt (tr.)"  "to melt (intr.)"  "to burn (intr.)"  "to burn (tr.)"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say for certain that Esperanto has a preference for one over the other, some proper analysis of the language's vocabulary and usage would have to be done. In my limited experience, I'd say that they're about equally common in Esperanto, but it's really not possible to say without a lot more research into Esperanto verbs and their usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7. Dative external possessors - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As @jknappen has pointed out, Esperanto &lt;strong&gt;does allow for dative external possessors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi lavas &lt;strong&gt;al mi&lt;/strong&gt; la manoj.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  "I wash my hands." (literally, "I wash to me the hands")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't personally speak for how common they are, but the only requirement for this criterion is that they exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;8. Negative pronouns and lack of verbal negation - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another easy one, as this SAE feature is &lt;strong&gt;explicitly spelled out in the basic 16 rules of Esperanto:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol start="12"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When another NEGATIVE word is present, the word NE [English no, not] is omitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Mi ne  venis     Neniu  venis    
  I  not come      No.one comes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;9. Particles in comparative constructions - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few ways of marking comparatives, but particle comparatives like the English "than" are pretty overwhelmingly SAE. Esperanto &lt;strong&gt;uses a particle comparative&lt;/strong&gt;, as its &lt;em&gt;ol&lt;/em&gt; is pretty much identical in function to English "that".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;10. Relative-based equative constructions - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto's equative construction &lt;em&gt;tiel ... kiel&lt;/em&gt; is actually more &lt;strong&gt;transparently based on relative clauses&lt;/strong&gt; than the English construction, as it uses synchronic relative correlatives -- and even the English "as ... as" construction is considered relative-based by Haspelmath. Another transparently SAE feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;11. Subject person affixes as strict agreement markers - ✗&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's far more common, cross-linguistically, for languages with person-marking to be pro-drop. However, several SAE languages (including French, German, and English) inflect the verb to agree with the person/number of the subject &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; allowing the subject to be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Esperanto is not pro-drop, to my knowledge, &lt;strong&gt;Esperanto does not inflect verbs to agree with the person or number of the subject&lt;/strong&gt;, and so it avoids this SAE feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;12. Intensifier-reflexive differentiation - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European languages verb frequently distinguish between intensifiers and reflexive pronouns, but using one form for both appears to be more common worldwide. English actually averts this, as it uses its reflexive in this intensifier function (e.g., "He did it himself").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esperanto's intensifier particle, &lt;em&gt;mem&lt;/em&gt;, is distinct from its reflexive pronoun &lt;em&gt;si&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Li batis sin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  "He hit himself."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Li mem batis ĝin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  "He hit it himself."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Esperanto is SAE in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;h1&gt;Tl;dr: Esperanto possesses about 8/12 SAE features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's go through these features one by one. This is going to be pretty long, sorry for that.

&lt;h2&gt;1. Definite and indefinite articles - ✗&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto defies SAE norms out the gate here, as it &lt;strong&gt;only has a definite article&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;libro&lt;/em&gt; - "a book"&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;la libro&lt;/em&gt; - "the book"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually quite bizarre, as those SAE languages that do not fit this criterion (such as Slavic languages, which heavily influenced Esperanto) have no articles at all.

&lt;/ul&gt;

  "That blue balloon, which I was holding, popped."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the relative clause &lt;em&gt;kion mi estis tenanta&lt;/em&gt; follows the nominal head &lt;em&gt;balono&lt;/em&gt;. It is introduced by an inflecting relative pronoun &lt;em&gt;kion&lt;/em&gt;, which is inflected for the accusative case to mark the balloon's role in the clause (that it is the object of &lt;em&gt;estas tenanta&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi flaras florojn.&lt;/em&gt; - "I smell flowers."&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"to melt (tr.)"  "to melt (intr.)"  "to burn (intr.)"  "to burn (tr.)"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say for certain that Esperanto has a preference for one over the other, some proper analysis of the language's vocabulary and usage would have to be done. In my limited experience, I'd say that they're about equally common in Esperanto, but it's really not possible to say without a lot more research into Esperanto verbs and their usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7. Dative external possessors - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As @jknappen has pointed out, Esperanto &lt;strong&gt;does allow for dative external possessors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi lavas &lt;strong&gt;al mi&lt;/strong&gt; la manoj.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  "I wash my hands." (literally, "I wash to me the hands")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't personally speak for how common they are, but the only requirement for this criterion is that they exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;8. Negative pronouns and lack of verbal negation - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another easy one, as this SAE feature is &lt;strong&gt;explicitly spelled out in the basic 16 rules of Esperanto:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol start="12"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When another NEGATIVE word is present, the word NE [English no, not] is omitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Mi ne  venis     Neniu  venis    
  I  not come      No.one comes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;9. Particles in comparative constructions - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few ways of marking comparatives, but particle comparatives like the English "than" are pretty overwhelmingly SAE. Esperanto &lt;strong&gt;uses a particle comparative&lt;/strong&gt;, as its &lt;em&gt;ol&lt;/em&gt; is pretty much identical in function to English "that".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;10. Relative-based equative constructions - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto's equative construction &lt;em&gt;tiel ... kiel&lt;/em&gt; is actually more &lt;strong&gt;transparently based on relative clauses&lt;/strong&gt; than the English construction, as it uses synchronic relative correlatives -- and even the English "as ... as" construction is considered relative-based by Haspelmath. Another transparently SAE feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;11. Subject person affixes as strict agreement markers - ✗&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's far more common, cross-linguistically, for languages with person-marking to be pro-drop. However, several SAE languages (including French, German, and English) inflect the verb to agree with the person/number of the subject &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; allowing the subject to be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Esperanto is not pro-drop, to my knowledge, &lt;strong&gt;Esperanto does not inflect verbs to agree with the person or number of the subject&lt;/strong&gt;, and so it avoids this SAE feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;12. Intensifier-reflexive differentiation - ✓&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European languages verb frequently distinguish between intensifiers and reflexive pronouns, but using one form for both appears to be more common worldwide. English actually averts this, as it uses its reflexive in this intensifier function (e.g., "He did it himself").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esperanto's intensifier particle, &lt;em&gt;mem&lt;/em&gt;, is distinct from its reflexive pronoun &lt;em&gt;si&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Li batis sin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  "He hit himself."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Li mem batis ĝin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  "He hit it himself."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Esperanto is SAE in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Possibility? Of course, there is always a possibility, but rather remote one, if you mean a full featured well-known modern language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best candidates are "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidance_speech" rel="noreferrer"&gt;taboo languages&lt;/a&gt;", where the lexical items are replaced because of taboo/religious pressure. Perhaps the best known is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyirbal_language" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Dyirbal&lt;/a&gt;, where a special version of the language is to be used in front of "tabooed" persons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it probably does not go millennia into the past, and it's questionable if it should be considered a language, since it is just a vocabulary encoding.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cant_(language)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Cryptolects (aka Cants or Secret languages)&lt;/a&gt; come to my mind as candidates. While they are typically not fully constructed, they often contain a constructed core vocabulary making the language unintelligible to outsiders. When they exist long enough, they are learned as first language by the group members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of such cryptolects include &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Verlan (French based)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_(bei_Mendig)#Dialekte_Beller_Platt_und_%E2%80%9EL%C3%A4ppe_Tallep%E2%80%9C" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Läppe Tellep (German dialect based)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;For the film &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; production designer Hannah Beachler created a Wakandan writing system &lt;a href="http://www.indiewire.com/2018/02/black-panther-wakanda-written-language-ryan-coogler-afrofuturism-1201931252/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;partially based on real African writing systems&lt;/a&gt;. Well that's what this and other news articles say, but if you look at how it's used, for example in the film's intertitles, it's clearly only a &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/q/535/113"&gt;transliteration alphabet&lt;/a&gt; of English:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mYsMy.jpg" alt="An example of an intertitle using the Wakandan writing"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SRsPj.jpg" alt="The English translation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see here how the letters are 1-1 mappings of the very non-phonemic English spellings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in the film, when the characters aren't speaking English, they are actually speaking Xhosa. (I'm not sure if in-universe that they are meant to be speaking Xhosa, or if Xhosa is just used to represent what would be a distinct Wakandan language in-universe, possibly related to Xhosa.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is any of the Wakandan writing in the film used to write Xhosa? Or any other African language, or even an actual conlang?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;People learn languages from other people who speak them. If someone ever got others to adopt his language as their "natural language," they would have had to learn it from him. Without a community of speakers, it would have been impossible for this to happen. At some point we have to account for the fact that someone would have had to design the language and actually teach it to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that this has never happened in &lt;em&gt;recorded history&lt;/em&gt;. We do indeed find that an early Greek philosopher named &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pherecydes_of_Syros" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Pherecydes&lt;/a&gt; invented an "artificial" word for "table":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He maintained that the divine name for "table" is θυωρός, or that which takes care of offerings. (&lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D11" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Diogenes Laertius 1.119&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence for anyone ever having invented an &lt;em&gt;entire language&lt;/em&gt;, which would certainly be much more notable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves thousands of years of prehistory (before the invention of writing) when this could have happened, but it seems much more difficult to design a language without writing, or, for that matter, to do it without the linguistic knowledge that exists today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coining of new words has always happened, but that is language change, which develops from an existing language, and not the invention of an entire language from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that there were &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; Wakandan scripts used in the set design of &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; -- one is the transliteration alphabet seen here, while the other is a se of symbols based on Nsibidi that is more logographic in nature. They were used on different parts of the set, with the more logographic script occurring in a lot of the more traditional contexts and the alphabet occurring more widely throughout the set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/wakandan.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;The Omniglot page&lt;/a&gt; for the script includes text written in both English and Xhosa using the script, but the Xhosa text seems transliterated from the romanized orthography for Xhosa. That said, since the author described the alphabetic script as a "more evolved" version of the logography, it's possible that it was deliberately designed to be similar to the Latin transliteration of Xhosa? Granted, that doesn't seem particularly in-character for the Wakanda depicted in the film, but who knows. Perhaps we'll learn more about the script in the inevitable sequel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say that the alphabetic script is not &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; used to transliterate English as it is in the title cards. Consider this image from the article, which features portions of some Wakandan signs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uZIKe.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uZIKe.jpg" alt="image of the streets of Wakanda with several signs in Wakandan scripts"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The glyphs on the rightward sign are difficult to make out and may be part of the logographic script, but those on the leftward sign read "DJO" in the Wakandan script -- as neither DJO nor OJD are allowable clusters in English, it seems unlikely that this is a portion of an English word transliterated into the alphabet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it definitely is used to transliterate English even outside of the title cards. Let's look at the text on the throne in this poster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbCtR.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbCtR.jpg" alt="image of black panther sitting on a throne decorated with Wakandan symbols"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text on the lefthand side of his throne clearly reads "WISDOM" and the righthand text reads "LOYALTY" -- obviously an English transliteration. This is particularly egregious given that this is the king's throne, which arguably shouldn't feature the modern Wakandan script at all, much less Wakandan being used for English. However, it is admittedly a poster, so it's not really properly in the movie -- I cannot find a screenshot of the base of the throne from the actual film, so I can't say whether the text is the same there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alphabetic script is frequently used in the set design of the lab, but the only screenshots I can find of it are either too blurry to make out or just feature simply the glyphs overlapping each other for aesthetic in a screensaver-esque fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;You could argue that modern Hebrew is at least partly constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebrew fell into disuse and only survived as a 'sacred' language in a religious context. Then, with the rise of the Zionist movement towards the end of the 19th Century, Hebrew was modernised and used as a &lt;em&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; in the Palestine region. In the process, aspects of Hebrew variants were combined, and the vocabulary was extended to allow the use of Hebrew in modern day life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revival_of_the_Hebrew_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia article on the Revival of Hebrew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Going along curiousdannii's idea of languages for &lt;em&gt;human idea exchange&lt;/em&gt;, there's an old joke that Python can be used in place of pseudocode, because of its use of English keywords, relatively little punctuation, and ease of understanding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of Kadane's algorithm, expressed in Python (from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem#Kadane's_algorithm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def max_subarray(A):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = A[0]
    for x in A[1:]:
        max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;aruslanovych asserts that languages have to convey emotion, metaphor, sensory impressions, etc. but I think this is a Romantic view. Is the Greek Linear B was used to write not a language since it was used for administrative record-keeping and probably tax purposes? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take a liberal view in that yes, programming languages can represent metaphors, abstraction, and idioms, just maybe not in the sense we're used to. In fact, computers are excellent at abstract concepts and generalizing, with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;duck typing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;object-oriented programming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;reflection&lt;/a&gt;. Off-topic, I daresay with deep learning, computers can generalize even better than humans can. And, sci-fi speculation, when robots become just as intelligent as humans, we have to consider their languages as "real". &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Yes, the vocabulary of a creole would be mixed, though it's likely that one of the parent languages provides most of the words. I concur with the previous answer to also look at English, since it does a few interesting things going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting language in that regard is the historical lingua franca, Sabir (a pidgin, and as such the precursor to a creole).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creoles tend to have fairly simple grammar, losing some of the complexity of their parent languages. I'm not sure if necessarily the easiest concepts prevail, but in general, the more rare and complex it is, the more likely it will be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest learning about different natlang creoles to get a basic understanding of the processes, similarities and differences based on the languages involved; you can find a list on Wikipedia that should get you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the more technical side, &lt;a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4607/98b73f9764f2ae09eaffe97aabc6cbdf6dff.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here is a PDF by McWhorter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935345.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199935345-e-13" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this article on Pidgins and Creoles by Baptista&lt;/a&gt; should also provide some more insight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In addition to the phonological and phonotactical aspects given by @b a, I want to add some more phonotactical and statistical features for an Elvish language&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Preference of front vowels /e, i/ over back vowels /o, u/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restriction of word-final sound, words tend to end in a vowel or in one of the consonants /t, d, θ, ð, n, s, r, l/&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The Volapük panoply of mood suffixes contains distinctions that were familiar to its audience through classicising education, but I think it fair to say they weren't in the immediate source languages: the optative, jussive, and potential moods as suffixes don't correspond to what German or English or French does morphologically; nor does giving a suffix to the apodosis of conditionals (if... &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt;). In fact, while the optative is Ancient Greek and the jussive is Sanskrit, the potential in Europe is limited to Finnish, and the apodosis suffix seems to be completely made of whole cloth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll add that, as with Esperanto, a lot of the compounding was schematic and not inspired by natural languages; the notorious example of &lt;em&gt;lu-&lt;/em&gt; "derogatory prefix" is probably the most obvious (&lt;em&gt;bien&lt;/em&gt; 'bee' &gt; &lt;em&gt;lubien&lt;/em&gt; 'wasp'; &lt;em&gt;vat&lt;/em&gt; 'water' &gt; &lt;em&gt;luvat&lt;/em&gt; 'urine').&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a contemporary case of someone teaching their kids their personal conlang, she used to be active on one of Facebook's conlang groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revived languages, Cornish, Hebrew, Sanskrit, have similar dynamics to conlangs. Having government support in the form of schools and day care works wonders for the project being successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting a child to speak your languages takes time (20+ hours a week) of exposure, and it really helps to have a community of peers who also speak that language, or a child's decision to keep using their parents language will be personal and idiosyncratic. I get this impression from people I've met who tried speaking Arabic or Icelandic to their kids in the US where they got plenty of exposure to their parents, but no particular supporting community of peers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Real languages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware of several types of writing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one would be &lt;strong&gt;left to right&lt;/strong&gt; and a prime example is &lt;strong&gt;English&lt;/strong&gt; and also most of other languages, no matter if they use letters or other symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another type would be &lt;strong&gt;right to left&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be seen in &lt;em&gt;Hebrew&lt;/em&gt; writing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X8lVa.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X8lVa.png" alt="illustration right to left"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the text in the image selected by me for illustration, a digital user interface of a Hebrew keyboard, is right bound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y785l.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y785l.jpg" alt="japanese text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above image you can see Japanese text, which is traditionally read from &lt;strong&gt;top to bottom&lt;/strong&gt; in either horizontal direction, in which I mean that both existed, not that you can read one text both from &lt;strong&gt;right to left&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;left to right&lt;/strong&gt; after going &lt;strong&gt;top to bottom&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Constructed languages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am wondering whether there is a &lt;em&gt;constructed&lt;/em&gt; language that reads from the middle. I am pretty sure that there is no traditional language that does this, hence I am attending here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yCJuM.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yCJuM.png" alt="concept"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me just create a concept here for you to understand. In such a language &lt;em&gt;above rows&lt;/em&gt; would have the &lt;em&gt;same meaning&lt;/em&gt;. In that case it is read horizontally, but from the middle, so that it does not matter if something appears on the left or right side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Gb5M.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Gb5M.png" alt="example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be able to understand what I mean by saying "&lt;em&gt;middle-written&lt;/em&gt;", i.e. you always start in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that a language like this should be really interesting and maybe useful, thus I am curious whether or not a constructed language written quite like this exists.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The best possible approach to a writing system "from the middle" is probably a text spiralling outwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One famous artefact, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaistos_Disc" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Phaistos Disk&lt;/a&gt;, shows a spiral layout of the text, but is is unknown whether it should be read inwards (most scholars prefer this) or outwards and the writing system is still undeciphered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your graphical samples suggest a symmetric progression of symbols to the right and left—I think this is unrealistic because lazyness and economy of writing will soon lead to the abandonment of one of the symmetric halves, leaving either right-to-left or -left-to-right writing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Is there a name for words that exist purely for syntactic reasons and carry no lexical meaning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason:&lt;br&gt;
Some forms of sentence in my language don't have verbs, but information such as tense and mood are indicated by affixes on the verb. So, in cases where you need to modify the verb, a meaningless verb fills in; the verb carries no meaning on its own, existing just to hold affixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is a sentence without a verb. No verb is used for just applying an adjective to a noun. Adjectives are applies directly to the noun.&lt;br&gt;
Mopifa-di-mopi&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Life-(adj-on)-wood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The wood is alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But (for example), past tense is marked by a suffix on the verb so it needs a verb to attach onto; ta "stands in" for the absent verb, giving -to (past tense) something to attach to.&lt;br&gt;
Ta-to mopifa-di-mopi&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(null)-(past) life-(adj-on)-wood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The wood was alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ta" is the word I'm talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

Some forms of sentence in my language don't have verbs, but information such as tense and mood are indicated by affixes on the verb. So, in cases where you need to modify the verb, a meaningless verb fills in; the verb carries no meaning on its own, existing just to hold affixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is a sentence without a verb. No verb is used for just applying an adjective to a noun. Adjectives are applies directly to the noun.&lt;br&gt;
Mopifa-di-mopi&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Life-(adj-on)-wood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The wood is alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But (for example), past tense is marked by a suffix on the verb so it needs a verb to attach onto; ta "stands in" for the absent verb, giving -to (past tense) something to attach to.&lt;br&gt;
Ta-to mopifa-di-mopi&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(null)-(past) life-(adj-on)-wood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The wood was alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ta" is the word I'm talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A common term for such a word would be &lt;strong&gt;auxiliary&lt;/strong&gt;. An example from the Australian language Walmajarri is &lt;em&gt;ma-rna-n-ta-lu&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;ma&lt;/em&gt; is the auxiliary to which the suffixes are attached. However as your word is used for carrying the TAM (Tense/Aspect/Mood) suffixes another term is &lt;strong&gt;copula&lt;/strong&gt;. Copulas are often verbs (such as the English &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;) but not in all languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a natlang I would strongly warn you that just because you haven't yet identified a meaning for the auxiliary, you shouldn't assume that it does not has one. As you're making a conlang you can declare that it truly has no meaning whatsoever, but do realise that makes it rather unnatural. In natlangs it's extremely uncommon to say something without it meaning something. For example, in Walmajarri the &lt;em&gt;ma&lt;/em&gt; auxiliary is one of two auxiliaries, which communicate different modality or information structure meanings. Unless the auxiliary is very short (in which case it could be analysed as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epenthesis" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;epenthetic&lt;/a&gt; or just an allomorph of the tense morpheme) then if naturalism is at all a design goal it should carry some semantic or pragmatic meaning. This gives you an opportunity to think of something interesting and perhaps even unique for your conlang.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As something of a follow-on to &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/466/how-to-naturalize-a-conlang"&gt;my question about &amp;ldquo;naturalizing&amp;rdquo; conlangs&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m looking for any information - actual tools would be nice, too, if available - for &amp;ldquo;borrowing&amp;rdquo; from one conlang into another in a realistic manner. There would be a number of subsidiary questions for this, some of which I include here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that I&amp;rsquo;m borrowing from &lt;em&gt;sourcelang&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;destlang&lt;/em&gt;, should I &lt;em&gt;destlang&lt;/em&gt;ize the word, or leave it in its &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; form (ignoring issues of orthography relative to different writing systems)? By &lt;em&gt;destlang&lt;/em&gt;ize, I mean things like&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the borrowed word take on the conjugation/declension pattern of &lt;em&gt;destlang&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the borrowed word get re-spelled to conform to &lt;em&gt;destlang&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s orthographical conventions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the borrowed word&amp;rsquo;s pronunciation get changed to conform to &lt;em&gt;destlang&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s phonemic conventions (e.g., elimination of consonant blends, all syllables must end in a vowel, etc.)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sort of methods exist for choosing &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; words to borrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What causes a &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; word to fall out of use in favor of a borrowing, or, contrariwise, why would both the &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; word and the borrowed word stay in use?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(At the suggestion of a commenter, I wish to make it clear that I am interested in this issue primarily with respect to &amp;ldquo;naturalistic&amp;rdquo; conlangs and natlangs.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One general term would be &lt;em&gt;function words&lt;/em&gt;; these are words that do not carry any lexical meaning, but are used to link content words together and clarify their relationships (eg in the case of prepositions or conjunctions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is indeed difficult to see exactly what you have in mind without any examples; other possibilities would be &lt;em&gt;particle&lt;/em&gt;, which is eg used in Japanese to mark certain grammatical features (such as 'direct object'). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people use the term &lt;em&gt;empty verb&lt;/em&gt; for the auxiliary in phrases like &lt;em&gt;to have/take a shower&lt;/em&gt;, where you could just use &lt;em&gt;to shower&lt;/em&gt; directly; here you can add the tense feature to the auxiliary as in &lt;em&gt;She &lt;strong&gt;had/took&lt;/strong&gt; a shower&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside: there are no words that "carry no meaning". If a word has no meaning, it is redundant, and would not be there at all. In linguistics you distinguish between lexical meaning and functional/grammatical meaning: the former you would find in a dictionary definition, whereas the latter is not always easy to put into words, as it describes relationships between elements in and structure of a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update after example:&lt;/strong&gt; Hard to say. A particle usually doesn't change its form (at least in English and most other natural languages I know), so the fact that the marker &lt;em&gt;-to&lt;/em&gt; is attached to it would rule that possibility out in my view. That would leave &lt;em&gt;empty verb&lt;/em&gt; as the most likely option, but then it is not really necessary when the marker is not used. I guess it would still be my preference, though. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I am not aware of a generic term covering all instances of function words without meaning, but only some specific cases. The pronoun &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; in phrases like &lt;em&gt;It's raining&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;It seems that ...&lt;/em&gt; is called a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_pronoun" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dummy pronoun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;pleonastic pronoun&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;expletive pronoun&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extending from this example one may call the particle &lt;em&gt;ta&lt;/em&gt; in the question a &lt;strong&gt;dummy verb&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are a few words in Esperanto that are arguably borrowed from Ido; examples include &lt;em&gt;olda&lt;/em&gt; "maljuna, malnova" and &lt;em&gt;kurta&lt;/em&gt; "mallonga". With respect to the subquestions: These words didn't need any changes, they already blend perfectly into Esperanto. The borrowings from Ido still are in a niche position in Esperanto and live mainly in the poetic register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course Ido (as a fork of Esperanto) shares a lot of vocabulary with Esperanto, but this is due to inheritance and not borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also remember vaguely that some of Tolkien's Elvish words were borrowings between Sindarin and Quenya, but unfortunately I don't have an example at hand. This would be a "constructed borrowing" between conlangs, adding to their naturalness and their diachronic depth.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Should I destlangize the word, or leave it in its “native” form?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In natural languages, borrowed words are almost always "&lt;em&gt;destlang&lt;/em&gt;-ized" to some degree, but it won't necessarily always to the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; degree. Even within the same language, often some borrowed words will be more integrated into the language than others. The more recently a word was borrowed, the more speakers of the language will treat it as a "foreign" word and be willing to make exceptions for it, but as its use becomes more and more common, speakers will inevitably begin to treat it as a native word if it doesn't fall out of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does the borrowed word take on the conjugation/declension pattern of destlang?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, sometimes not. There are examples of both in natlangs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English verb "to google" has been borrowed into many languages, and it seems to typically conform to the conjugation patterns of those languages. Even in Japanese, a language with a famously closed class of verbs, borrowed "to google" as a verb ググる(it may have become a verb after being borrowed as a noun, but either way, it's quite remarkable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it's also possible for exceptions to be made. This happens with some English noun borrowings (most English speakers won't try to pluralize &lt;em&gt;edamame&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; with English plural morphology), but not with others (many English speakers will pluralize &lt;em&gt;zucchini&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;zucchinis&lt;/em&gt;, and you'll pretty much never heard &lt;em&gt;zucchino&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, verbs are more likely to take on the native conjugation patterns than nouns are native declension patterns, but I don't have any data to back that up cross-linguistically. A borrowed word &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; definitely more likely to be conjugated or declined like a native one the longer it has been in the language (the pedantry about pluralizing Latin borrowings in English is an exception to this, but that's more because of the social prestige associated with having studied Latin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does the borrowed word get re-spelled to conform to destlang’s orthographical conventions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really is a case-by-case thing. If the language uses a completely different writing system, almost definitely, but sometimes the orthographical conventions won't be the same as native words. Japanese uses katakana for borrowings, for instance, and English borrowings from Japanese and Chinese tend to follow whatever romanization scheme was most popular when they were borrowed, even if the pronunciation is pretty opaque. For instance, the Chinese word 道 was borrowed as "Tao" in English based on older Chinese romanizations, even though the Chinese word now romanized as &lt;em&gt;dào&lt;/em&gt; and the English derived word "Taoism" is more often pronounced /ˈdaʊ.ɪzəm/ in English (though a spelling pronunciation /ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm/ has arisen due to this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does the borrowed word’s pronunciation get changed to conform to destlang’s phonemic conventions (e.g., elimination of consonant blends, all syllables must end in a vowel, etc.)?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Almost always yes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; While sometimes educated speakers or upper-class speakers will try to pronounce a borrowed word with its "original pronunciation" rather than its borrowed one ("gyro" is a good example of this), even those pronunciations are almost always somewhat changed to fit the destlang's phonology better, and often they aren't even closer to the pronunciation in the sourcelang. How exactly the word is altered to fit the destlang's phonology depends on the particulars of the borrowing situation, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What sort of methods exist for choosing which words to borrow? What causes a “native” word to fall out of use in favor of a borrowing, or, contrariwise, why would both the “native” word and the borrowed word stay in use?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've combined these questions because I feel there's a lot of overlap in the answers. Often, words are borrowed to fill a semantic gap in the destlang, which is why words for new technologies are so often borrowed (think of how many languages borrowed the word "television"!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borrowings are also often used to refer to the "versions" of certain things from the part of the world that speaks that language -- consider how &lt;em&gt;anime&lt;/em&gt;, a generic word for all animation in Japanese, was borrowed into English as a word for a style of Japanese animation, or how English borrowed "chai" from the Hindi/Urdu word for tea, चाय (cāy) / چای‎ (ćāy) to refer to tea with certain spices based on Indian recipes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, sometimes words are borrowed because they carry some social value seen attractive by the speakers of destlang. Maybe destlang speakers think sourcelang sounds refined and sophisticated, and so upper-class destlang speakers borrow words from sourcelang to sound fancy. Of course, this sort of situation depends on a lot of social and sociopolitical factors wherever the languages are spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;h1&gt;Should I destlangize the word, or leave it in its “native” form?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In natural languages, borrowed words are almost always "&lt;em&gt;destlang&lt;/em&gt;-ized" to some degree, but it won't necessarily always to the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; degree. Even within the same language, often some borrowed words will be more integrated into the language than others. The more recently a word was borrowed, the more speakers of the language will treat it as a "foreign" word and be willing to make exceptions for it, but as its use becomes more and more common, speakers will inevitably begin to treat it as a native word if it doesn't fall out of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does the borrowed word take on the conjugation/declension pattern of destlang?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, sometimes not. There are examples of both in natlangs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English verb "to google" has been borrowed into many languages, and it seems to typically conform to the conjugation patterns of those languages. Even in Japanese, a language with a famously closed class of verbs, borrowed "to google" as a verb ググる(it may have become a verb after being borrowed as a noun, but either way, it's quite remarkable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it's also possible for exceptions to be made. This happens with some English noun borrowings (most English speakers won't try to pluralize &lt;em&gt;edamame&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; with English plural morphology), but not with others (many English speakers will pluralize &lt;em&gt;zucchini&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;zucchinis&lt;/em&gt;, and you'll pretty much never heard &lt;em&gt;zucchino&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, verbs are more likely to take on the native conjugation patterns than nouns are native declension patterns, but I don't have any data to back that up cross-linguistically. A borrowed word &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; definitely more likely to be conjugated or declined like a native one the longer it has been in the language (the pedantry about pluralizing Latin borrowings in English is an exception to this, but that's more because of the social prestige associated with having studied Latin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does the borrowed word get re-spelled to conform to destlang’s orthographical conventions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really is a case-by-case thing. If the language uses a completely different writing system, almost definitely, but sometimes the orthographical conventions won't be the same as native words.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;An addition to Sparksbet's excellent answer I'd add one tool to your armamentarium:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DENATURALISATION of BORROWINGS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes foreign words borrowed a long time ago from L1 become naturalised in L2 only to become &lt;em&gt;denaturalised&lt;/em&gt; again in later times. In other words, the legitimately L2 word becomes more like the antecedent L1 word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case in point, &lt;em&gt;PEKING&lt;/em&gt;. English borrowed this city name centuries ago and happily naturalised it (as we tend to do sooner or later with every word we borrow!). But recently, you've probably noticed an odd spelling &lt;em&gt;"BEIJING"&lt;/em&gt;. For some strange reason, this word has de-evolved from its naturalised form to something approaching a modern Mandarin pronunciation-spelling of the name, rather than the English pronunciation of the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn't always happen. Thus far, we continue to pronounce &lt;em&gt;Baile Átha Cliath&lt;/em&gt; as DUBLIN; &lt;em&gt;Moskva&lt;/em&gt; as MOSCOW; and &lt;em&gt;Krung Thep Maha Nakhon&lt;/em&gt; as BANGKOK.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There is something about language, which seems so obvious to us humans that it is rarely stated: Language is encoded in a linear, one-dimensional fashion. 
The words you utter (and the sillables in those words; and the phonemes in those sillables) form an ordered sequence in time. Imagine e.g. dicating a table to someone else: You have to pick a certain manner of saying each item in the table (e.g. "each row after one another" vs. "each column after another") You have to come up with a &lt;em&gt;map&lt;/em&gt; (and agree upon with your correspondent!) from the two-dimensional paper to the one-dimensional verbal language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, picking a direction of writing is perfectly analogous to drawing a curve (a line) on your writing material. There are many different ways you  can do such a thing, the ones that natural languages use have a tendency to be &lt;em&gt;sensible&lt;/em&gt; by virtue of being simple to write down, and not too ambiguous to read. 
Some examples (with no claim to completeness): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;left-to-right (see e.g. Latin script) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;right-to-left (see e.g. Arabic script) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;top-to-bottom (see e.g. Japanese)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spiraling inwards, both clockwise and anticlockwise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spiraling outwards, both clockwise and anticlockwise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the manner of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;furrows a plough makes&lt;/a&gt;; (also with arbitrary starting directions, and perhaps vertically instead of horizontally)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I did not quite understand your own examples, as they seem to violate that basic rule of being linearly encoded and not redundant. You can of course come up with orderings like "975312468" or "864213579"; which can certainly be described as "reading from the middle in a horizontal way". The problem with those is that it feels very cumbersome to write or read in such a fashion, as your eyes have to skip around way too much. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Apart from the word for "forehead" being diagnostically different in the various dialects of Klingon (as pointed out by @JeffZeitlin), the only other canonical information I know of is that in some dialects, &lt;D&gt; and &lt;b&gt; /ɖ, b/ are pronounced as /ɳ, m/ (&lt;N&gt; and &lt;M&gt;—though I don't remember if those transliterations are canonical, or invented by me for the Klingon &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: More about dialects from &lt;a href="http://klingonska.org/piqad/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://klingonska.org/piqad/&lt;/a&gt;, citing &lt;em&gt;Klingon for the Galactic Traveller&lt;/em&gt;. (I was right that I made up &lt;M&gt;, and &lt;N&gt; is not canonical.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Tak’ev Dialect&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Dialect spoken in the Tak’ev (taq­’ev) region. It is one of the larger
  minority dialects and has a much greater number of speakers that the
  Krotmag dialect. It sounds like blend of Krotmag an Standard Klingon,
  and is the one dialect (that we know of) which most closely resembles
  Standard Klingon. It is only briefly described in canon.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nasal vowels &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pronounces b as mb &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pronounces D as ND&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The Krotmag Dialect&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Dialect spoken in the Krotmag (Qot­magh) region. This dialect has
  fewer speakers than the Tak’ev dialect, but is well known and easily
  recognized by other Klingons. Some of the dialects peculiarities have
  even influenced Standard Klingon.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nasal vowels &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pronounces b as m (as in English mime) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pronounces D as N&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Often uses extra words in noun phrases, originally to differentiate between words with b and m (e.g. ’uS qam leg foot, nach qam head face), but now prevalent even when no disambiguation is needed (e.g. NeS ghop arm hand, nach ghIch head nose, qorNu’ tuq family house and even yan ’etlh or ’etlh yan sword sword) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Often adds short extra sentences to disambiguate between verbs with b and m (e.g. mI­moH. yI­jot­choH. You’re impatient. Calm down!, mI­moH. ’oy’ mInNu’­wIj. You’re ugly. My eyes ache.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The Morskan Dialect&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Dialect spoken on the conquered Klingon world Morska. We’re treated to
  brief bout of the Morskan dialect of Klingon in ST6 when Enterprise
  encounters a Klingon listening post. (The Klingon spelling of the word
  “Morska” is unknown – the only canon occurrence is in spoken form, in
  the Morskan dialect, by that guard in ST6).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The Morskan dialect is characterized by the following speech patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pronounces tlh as ghl at the beginning of syllables, and as ts (as in English cats) at the end &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pronounces H as h (as in English hat) at beginning of syllables, and not pronounced at all at end &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pronounces Q as Standard Klingon H &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Usually drops -’e’ from the final noun in “to
  be” phrases (except when the subject of such phrases are emphasised)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Morskan dialect is characterized by the following speech patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pronounces tlh as ghl at the beginning of syllables, and as ts (as in English cats) at the end &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pronounces H as h (as in English hat) at beginning of syllables, and not pronounced at all at end &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pronounces Q as Standard Klingon H &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Usually drops -’e’ from the final noun in “to
  be” phrases (except when the subject of such phrases are emphasised)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Is there an order in which you write the strokes making up a letter belonging to the Klingon alphabet (apart from the Latin alphabet)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are letters from Klingon alphabets intended to be written manually, as opposed to solely being printed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_alphabets" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Klingon alphabets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.klingonwiki.net/En/PIqaD" rel="noreferrer"&gt;pIqaD&lt;/a&gt; but neither had information about this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There have been stroke ordering proposals by fans devising handwriting of pIqaD. One is &lt;a href="http://klingonska.org/writing/examples/pic/zrajm-piqad.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://klingonska.org/writing/examples/pic/zrajm-piqad.jpg&lt;/a&gt; , from  Zrajm of Klingonska Akademien: &lt;a href="http://klingonska.org/piqad/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://klingonska.org/piqad/&lt;/a&gt;. Another had been proposed by the late Glen Proechel's group:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Interstellar Language School (lead by Glen F. Proechel) has published “An Alien Writing System Primer” explaining how to write pI­qaD in longhand. (It is non-canon, of course – and to my knowledge not endorsed by the KLI.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 20 years ago, I've seen it, and I don't remember it. (I do remember not liking it. ;^)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Its common for languages to borrow the words for trade goods introduced to them by other cultures. These are called 'Wanderwoerter', or 'wandering words' in German. All the words for 'tea' in our world, for instance, can be traced back to just two distinct roots. One gave rise to the word for tea in China and Mongolia, the other is the common ancestor for the words for 'tea' everywhere else. Words for region-specific materials also tend to get borrowed. Though they can also just be named after foreign locations that the people who speak the destlang got the material from (we have quite a number of these in English).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Words for technologies also tend to migrate. Hungarian has multiple words related to horse riding that originated in Turkish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note how English likes to borrow foreign words for foreign objects. We have words like sombrero from Spanish and kimono from Japanese. Note however that borrowed words may not hold the same meaning as they do in their parent languages. In Spanish the word 'sombrero' is the word for any hat with a brim. And kimono is the name for a specific garment, but in English we normally use it to refer to any kind of traditional Japanese dress. This is pretty common cross-linguistically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that some languages borrow foreign words more than others. Some prefer to just derive new words from native words. Finnish used to be like this. German still is to a large extent (though that doesn't mean loan words don't exist in German, there are a few from French and English, such as bon-bon, pommes frites, and jeans).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It seems that people generally use constructed languages in very limited circumstances, or within small communities that speak the language.  Thus it seems to me unlikely that one of these languages would every be someone's first or only language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any documented cases of a child learning a conlang as their first language?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Yes. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto" rel="noreferrer"&gt;According to Wikipedia,&lt;/a&gt; Esperanto has 350 native speakers (data 1996). &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/19/darmond-speers-dad-spoke_n_363477.html?guccounter=1" rel="noreferrer"&gt;There is also a story about a linguist only speaking to his son in Klingon,&lt;/a&gt; but even though the child picked it up somewhat, later in life the child stopped speaking Klingon. Currently, he doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, see &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/2wopi7/was_on_front_page_we_are_native_speakers_of/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Esperanto native speaker AMA on reddit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://stelachiamnurkritikas.wordpress.com/2018/02/04/native-esperanto-speaker-the-jubilee-child-part-1/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;a blog I enjoyed about speaking Esperanto natively&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Some auxiliary languages are easier to learn than natural languages. There have been &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaedeutic_value_of_Esperanto" rel="noreferrer"&gt;many experiments&lt;/a&gt; that show that Esperanto is both easier to learn than other languages, and also makes learning future languages easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two quotes from some of the experiments on Esperanto:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"It is possible for the average student to understand written and spoken Esperanto in 20 hours better than he can understand French, German, Italian, or Spanish after 100 hours."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"A child can learn as much Esperanto in about 6 months as he would French in 3–4 years... if all children studied Esperanto during the first 6–12 months of a 4–5 year French course, they would gain much and lose nothing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it's not necessarily true that auxiliary languages are meant to be learnt faster than natural languages. Esperanto is a very regular language, and that makes it easy to learn. Other languages, such as Interlingua, are not as easy to learn, but are meant to be more recognizable to someone already familiar with the vocabulary of Romance languages. It is still more regular than the natural languages it's based on, so it likely is easier to learn, but it sacrifices some regularity in order to have a more familiar vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Every language (I know of) needs a context or a mark of reference for understanding a lot of the expressed message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm refering about concepts like &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd bet there is no organic language that doesn't use such contextual words. Still, though, I wondered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any constructed language that has no word context-dependant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is: How does it manage to express common messages?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there isn't: Would it be possible to have such language?&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I have thought about this too before. Actually, only one word is needed for all of &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;, etc. You can analyse these as I, (the person I am referring to), (the thing I am referring to at/by/on ME), (the place I am referring to not at/by/on ME), (the day which is one day later than the day I am in). This goes for most words like those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not that I know of. But let's create one for demonstration purposes: &lt;em&gt;Loj-&lt;strong&gt;ban mi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It is Lojban, but there's a ban on the word &lt;em&gt;mi&lt;/em&gt; (and &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;ti&lt;/em&gt;, and other words incorporating &lt;em&gt;mi&lt;/em&gt; as said above).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, as we proved above with Loj-&lt;strong&gt;ban mi&lt;/strong&gt;, it is possible. &lt;em&gt;Would it be learnable?&lt;/em&gt; Probably. But not usable in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I have thought about this too before. Actually, only one word is needed for all of &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;, etc. You can analyse these as I, (the person I am referring to), (the thing I am referring to at/by/on ME), (the place I am referring to not at/by/on ME), (the day which is one day later than the day I am in). This goes for most words like those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not that I know of. But let's create one for demonstration purposes: &lt;em&gt;Loj-&lt;strong&gt;ban mi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It is Lojban, but there's a ban on the word &lt;em&gt;mi&lt;/em&gt; (and &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;ti&lt;/em&gt;, and other words incorporating &lt;em&gt;mi&lt;/em&gt; as said above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be able to express concepts like 'Bananas grow on trees', as this doesn't depend on the concept I. However, saying stuff like &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My&lt;/strong&gt; name is Santa Claus.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&lt;/strong&gt;'s going well.&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;What are &lt;strong&gt;we&lt;/strong&gt; doing &lt;strong&gt;tomorrow&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; would be impossible.&lt;br&gt;
We could replace it with other concepts, for example, 'the speaker/writer'. But this is ambiguous, take this sentence: &lt;em&gt;I don't know who said that, but the speaker is in big trouble when I find out!&lt;/em&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Belter Creole is a conlang creole spoken in the novel series &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; by James S. A. Corey. When the novel was adapted into a TV series they got linguist Nick Farmer to develop the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there substantial differences between the Belter Creole of the books and the show? Or is what is in the books just less developed, and Farmer created a more complete but still fully compatible version for the show? Do the later novels, from after the show started to be produced, use Farmer's version or Corey's original version? &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One thing you may want to consider is how the sourcelang word reached the destlang. If the word was spread through literature to the destlang speakers, then it may be spelled the same as it is in the sourcelang but pronounced according to the pronunciation of the destlang. If the word is spread through oral communication then it may sound like the sourcelang but be spelled differently. One example would be &lt;em&gt;ray&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;rai&lt;/em&gt;), a Spanish word descended from the English &lt;em&gt;ride&lt;/em&gt; as in &lt;em&gt;I got a ride home&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing you may want to consider is the possibility of usages that sourcelang speakers may consider "incorrect". An example of this would be the French word &lt;em&gt;le parking&lt;/em&gt;, which means &lt;em&gt;car park&lt;/em&gt; in English. In the case of "incorrect" usage the important thing to consider is which social societal group naturalized the word and in what context. If the word was naturalized by academics, then it may continue to be pronounced and used the same way it is in the sourcelang (as in the cases of many Latin words used in English). If it was naturalized by non-linguists in normal social contexts, then it may be naturalized with spelling errors, mispronunciations, and odd usages (consider &lt;em&gt;le shopping&lt;/em&gt; in every day French).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In many natlangs a grammatical distinction is made between &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possession_(linguistics)#Alienable_and_inalienable" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;alienable and inalienable possession&lt;/a&gt;. Inalienable possession is used for things which are in some way conceptualised as being inseparable from their possessor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lévy-Bruhl (and then later Chappell &amp; McGregor) identified that natural languages with a morphologically distinct inalienable possession use inalienable possession for four categories: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spatial relationships such as the ‘top’ or ‘front’ of something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;physical parts, especially human body parts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kinship bonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;objects which are essential for a person’s survival&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the conlangs with inalienable possession, do they also use it for all four of these categories? Do any conlangs have inalienable possession for a type of nominal relationship which doesn't fit into any of these categories?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;strong&gt;list of languages&lt;/strong&gt; question, which on this site means that multiple answers presenting different languages are allowed. However, if possible, do present as many languages as you can in a post. Conlangs newly constructed to answer this question are not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Lojban differentiates between inalienable possession, alienable possession, and association: &lt;em&gt;po'e, po, pe&lt;/em&gt;. But Lojban does so because its design aspired to typological completeness: it's followed the textbooks in its differentiation between alienable and inalienable possession. See &lt;a href="http://www.lojban.org/static/publications/refgram_chunked/cllc/8/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.lojban.org/static/publications/refgram_chunked/cllc/8/3/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Something is intrinsically (or inalienably) possessed by someone if the possession is part of the possessor, and cannot be changed without changing the possessor. In the case of Example 3.5, people are usually taken to intrinsically possess their arms: even if an arm is cut off, it remains the arm of that person." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So (2) physical parts. (Lojban deals with (1) as a predicate relation, not a possession.) Not (4), as far as I know. Logically (3) kinship bonds should be inalienable as well, but those too are represented in Lojban as predicate relations. (In fact the expression of relations between entities through overt predicates diminishes the role of possessives in Lojban overall.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I’m going to try to avoid any kind of argument about politics, religion or what does or does not count as a “conlang,” and just give this as a historical case that I think is relevant to the spirit of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biblical Hebrew was a natural language, and Rabbinic Hebrew a scholarly one, but modern Hebrew needed a vast number of neologisms, greatly exceeding the number of ancient words in the Bible.  Since most of the early revivalists were native speakers of Central and Eastern European languages, those also influenced its development.  So Eliezer Ben-Yehuda’s dictionary of modern Hebrew words, many of which he himself invented or extended the definitions of, bears some similarities to creating the vocabulary of a conlang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and his wife were famously the first parents in modern times to raise their child to know only Hebrew and nothing else.  Their son Ittamar Ben-Avi, born in 1882, would later recall that he was sent to his room whenever any guests came over who did not speak Hebrew, so he would not hear another language, and that his father became enraged when he caught his mother singing lullabies to him in her native Russian.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I believe I've mentioned before on here how I struggle to come up with forms for letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried to solve this by looking at other systems. Despite the diversity in our world, I've found it surprisingly hard to find a multitude of systems to draw from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is: writing systems have different factors that can influence their design. Syllabraries tend to have more complex characters than alphabets, because they don't have to write as many of them to spell out a word. And besides, they need a wider diversity of symbols anyway. Logographic systems are no different. Also the medium makes a huge difference. The aesthetic of one script may not be too practical to replicate using a medium it wasn't intended for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found this all divides up writing systems into multiple different categories based on design. This means that if you stick with a certain medium and type of writing system, you won't have much to go off of. Like, if you look at alphabets, all that really seems to be out there is Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Korean. And if you look at cursive scripts, you only really have two options: English cursive, and Arabic, which is technically an abjad. And of course if you want a logographic system, the only living logographic system (aka, the only one to see use in a world where literacy was normal writing was part of every day life) is Chinese. Beyond that, all you have to look at are long extinct logographic systems that were all made to be carved into stone. Or cuneiform, which used some rather odd tools and medium to write. How many systems do you know of that were written in clay, and were always stamped rather than drawn?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't come up with forms that really look overly different from the few alphabets currently in use. Worse yet, most of them are closely related to each other! It seems like every symbol possible has already been used in a writing system somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that has really helped me is I've noticed that most lower-case Latin letters are built from a limited number of shapes: a circle, loop, short line, long line, long line with a loop, and a dot. Sadly, I can't really come up with any practical letter forms that don't use these shapes. They're pretty simple and basic.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;I believe I've mentioned before on here how I struggle to come up with forms for letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried to solve this by looking at other systems. Despite the diversity in our world, I've found it surprisingly hard to find a multitude of systems to draw from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is: writing systems have different factors that can influence their design. Syllabraries tend to have more complex characters than alphabets, because they don't have to write as many of them to spell out a word. And besides, they need a wider diversity of symbols anyway. Logographic systems are no different. Also the medium makes a huge difference. The aesthetic of one script may not be too practical to replicate using a medium it wasn't intended for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found this all divides up writing systems into multiple different categories based on design. This means that if you stick with a certain medium and type of writing system, you won't have much to go off of. Like, if you look at alphabets, all that really seems to be out there is Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Korean. And if you look at cursive scripts, you only really have two options: English cursive, and Arabic, which is technically an abjad. And of course if you want a logographic system, the only living logographic system (aka, the only one to see use in a world where literacy was normal writing was part of every day life) is Chinese. Beyond that, all you have to look at are long extinct logographic systems that were all made to be carved into stone. Or cuneiform, which used some rather odd tools and medium to write. How many systems do you know of that were written in clay, and were always stamped rather than drawn?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't come up with forms that really look overly different from the few alphabets currently in use. Worse yet, most of them are closely related to each other! It seems like every symbol possible has already been used in a writing system somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;After all, there is a limited number of shapes that one can draw with reasonable effort. You can measure the effort for writing a character in a writing system by the number of strokes needed. For alphabets, there should be no more than 5 strokes, for a syllabary maybe 7 or 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are more shapes available than you may think: For a relatively recent (in terms of writing systems) invention, you can look at the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Aboriginal_syllabics" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics&lt;/a&gt; having a distinct look from other writing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The different Indic writing systems are also a good source of inspiration: While sharing a common set of characters and common principles, the letter shapes are always different in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmic_scripts" rel="noreferrer"&gt;various Indic&lt;/a&gt; and Indic inspired (like Thai or Khmer) scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is still possible to invent a new and distinct writing system from scratch: Tolkien's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengwar" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Tengwar&lt;/a&gt; shows clear external influences (from Indic scripts and from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lodwick" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Francis Lodwick's Universal Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;) but is clearly distinguished from both sources of inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I want to draw a map of a fictional world resembling Europe in climate and basic geographic features (so there are rivers and lakes, alpine mountains, mittelgebirge, marsh lands and bogs, some plains and forests).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of dithematic words (similar to typical &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics)#Semantic_classification" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;endocentric compound words&lt;/a&gt; where the second part denotes the general feature and the first part gives a distinguishing detail), so I need words for river, lake, mountain, marsh, bog etc. and some determining words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I want the words to look naturalistic and not overly schematic. What techniques can I use to make the geographical features look naturalistic? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Assume that I have already designed a phonology for my conlang stub, and that I have already some phonotactics and candidate root words. What I am interested in is some natural looking variation of the names to generate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that there are PLENTY of word frequency lists around, but almost no one ever bothers to even try compiling cross-linguistic ones (for reasons that should be pretty obvious). Lists for English, furthermore, hardly ever even attempt to separate different word categories (again for reasons that ought to be obvious).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Conlangers-Lexipedia-Mark-Rosenfelder/dp/1493733001" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Conlanger Lexipedia&lt;/a&gt; is based off a &lt;a href="http://www.zompist.com/resources/wordlist.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1500 roots list&lt;/a&gt; (with some caveats) compiled from a 1.1 million word corpus of science-fantasy writing. You can count the verbs yourself... once you decide what counts as a verb (the list can't tell apart verb vs. adjective vs. noun uses, and the commoner an English content word, the likelier it is to drift between noun/verb/adjective).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top 200 words (page 36-37 of the book) have the following roots that are "primarily" verbs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;go, will, know, see, come, like, would, could [end of top 50 words, &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; is 49]
  look, give, seem, must, call, think, make, ask, work, run, mean, may, wear, feel, want, stand, hear, open, should, end, keep, sit, need, turn, move, try, begin, place, close, talk, can, get, take, tell, find, speak, might, let, hold, fall, bring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be mindful of the biases introduced by an English list&lt;/strong&gt;: the English auxiliary system, in particular, wouldn't be reproduced in any other languages as the past forms (and very often the main forms!) would be regular verbal inflections instead of separate forms. Arguably, I shouldn't have included the auxiliary verbs at all, really:strictly speaking these verb have no infinitive form to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are many factors that make actual real-world placename not look schematic (unless, maybe, you're looking at Japanese placenames...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have many different etymological sources from names&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, names have a lot of forms, and the younger the names, the more varied the forms: religious names (i.e. saints) and feasts, people names ("X's place", "X's farm", "X's dwelling" are all very common sources of names, but just look at how many us towns are named after female given names!), other placenames (e.g. Athens, Georgia), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer the source languages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European names show variety at least in part because the names comes from many layers of languages: France has names in modern French from Germanic, Celtic, Romance (French, Old French, Spanish, Latin roots), and pre-IE languages. In England you have Scottish, Celtic, Old English, Normand and Old Norse/Danish names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People really don't pay that much attention to the form of a word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple example is how &lt;em&gt;common&lt;/em&gt; "new town" is as a name: Newton, Newcastle, Villeneuve, Neuville, Villanueva, Villanova, Neustadt, Neuburg, Novgorod, Novohrad, Nevşehir, Yenişehir...  All of these are fairly common city names in their respective languages. "Blue Lake" may not feel original, but to te people who come later, it's just a name like any other. The same as we don't really &lt;em&gt;notice&lt;/em&gt; "Rowan" or "Rose"  are common nouns once they are people's name.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The first thing is: Design not only one word for each geographical feature, use several of them. To give some examples from a natural language (German in this case): A mountain may have a name in &lt;em&gt;-berg&lt;/em&gt; (which is frequent in the mittelgebirge) but also &lt;em&gt;-spitze&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;-horn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;-kopf&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;-kuppe&lt;/em&gt;. Some beacon mountains have names of their own without an element meaning "mountain" (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Brocken&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Großer Belchen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kahler Asten&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Eiger&lt;/em&gt;). Similarly, cities are not just &lt;em&gt;-stadt&lt;/em&gt; "city", but there are also cities in Germany with names in &lt;em&gt;-burg&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;-berg&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;-heim&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;-reut&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;-furt&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;-hafen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing is: Hydronyms are special. The names of larger rivers often reflect an older substrate and are not taken from the current language of the place and don't have any transparent meaning. Examples are &lt;em&gt;Potomac&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Arkansas&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mississippi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Missouri&lt;/em&gt; in the USA or &lt;em&gt;Thames&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rhine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rhône&lt;/em&gt;, and more in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the names on the map should show some interesting variation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I have found a conlang, Klyran, which has a rather interesting feature: multiple imperative moods. Quoting from &lt;a href="http://planeshift.top-ix.org/pswiki/index.php?title=Klyros_Language#Grammatical_moods" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For imperative mood there are number of suffixes that correspond to different sort of request from begging to ordering with threat of killing in case of refusal. These suffixes can be omitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For the case of an suffixless imperative form, a "default" form of the imperative mood is presumed, similar to a real-world imperative in meaning.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this part of the language has not been fully fleshed out (nobody yet has bothered to define the various imperative mood affixes) -- is this feature (multiple imperative moods) something that has existing terminology surrounding it?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I don't think there is any really reliable cross-linguistic labelling system that would include all of these. There are terms for most of them, but they're often used for only a few languages, and perhaps not very consistently. For someone who is created a conlang, they have flexibility then to adapt these terms for their language, however the important thing is to clearly describe in detail the full semantics of the language, rather than just assigning labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broad category for all of these is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontic_modality" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;deontic modality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which covers the modality of how the speaker thinks things ought to be. Within deontic modality there are many subtypes. The &lt;a href="https://glossary.sil.org/term/deontic-modality" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SIL Glossary&lt;/a&gt; has a very useful section giving a hierarchical description of deontic modality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;English actually has a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_modal_verbs" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;very large number of modal verbs&lt;/a&gt;, with subtly different senses, so with examples from English we can illustrate a lot of the subtypes, even though they're usually not given clear labels. The English modals are however very complex, most of them being used in different contexts to mean very different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;imperative&lt;/strong&gt; is actually one of the least marked ways of issuing a directive/command. In English it is a structurally different way of forming a sentence, but in other languages it may have a more regular structure with a particular verb form that fits into a wider affix paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Should&lt;/em&gt; is usually weaker than the imperative, giving a recommendation. Possible labels include &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hortative" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hortative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositive_mood" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;propositive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have to&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;need to&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; can all be stronger than the imperative, but they also often imply that the person giving the instruction needs to plead to some extent with those they are instructing; an autocratic dictator would never tell their servants that they need to do something, they would simply tell them to do it (with an imperative sentence.) Labels include &lt;a href="https://glossary.sil.org/term/precative-mood" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;precative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for requests, and &lt;a href="https://glossary.sil.org/term/directive-modality" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;directive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://glossary.sil.org/term/obligative-mood" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obligative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for commands that emphasise obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;shall&lt;/em&gt; are emphasised and stressed in English they are used to indicate a serious instruction, which sometimes sound almost sinister with an implied threat for those who disregard them: "You &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; do this... (or else!)" The label &lt;a href="https://glossary.sil.org/term/commissive-modality" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;commissive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is used for threats, but not exclusively, as it's also used for promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;By design (looking at the &lt;a href="http://literaturo.org/HARLOW-Don/Esperanto/rules.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;16 rules of Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;) there is no verbal aspect in the Esperanto grammar. However, one can see an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchoative_aspect" rel="noreferrer"&gt;incohative aspect&lt;/a&gt; in the prefix &lt;em&gt;ek-&lt;/em&gt; (e.g., &lt;em&gt;mi ekridas&lt;/em&gt; "I burst out laughing").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More controversial is the question of a perfective/imperfective aspect (see &lt;a href="https://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/1724/are-the-compound-verb-tenses-ever-really-used-in-esperanto"&gt;this question and its differing answers&lt;/a&gt;) or a continuative aspect. Those aspects do not even occur in a pure form in English (despite tenses named *present perfect or present continous).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the verbal aspects in Esperanto and how are they expressed?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Whoever told you Esperanto lacks verbal aspect was lying to you. Yes, aspect isn't mentioned in the 16 Rules. However, this clearly doesn't mean Esperanto completely lacks aspect -- the 16 Rules are not intended to be a linguistically rigorous analysis of Esperanto, but merely a set of easy rules to teach laymen. Zamenhof definitely designed Esperanto containing some aspectual markers, especially given the amount of influence he took from Slavic languages; what is unclear is exactly &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; aspectual information he intended to be encoded in certain markers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on your description of Esperanto's complex tenses and your claim that "these aspects do not even occur in a pure form in English", you seem to be under the impression that to truly be present in a language, an aspect must be marked by a single morpheme rather than through syntactic constructions like the verb + participle constructions in English and Esperanto "complex tenses." However, that isn't how that works. The English present/past continuous constructions do mark progressive/continuous aspect. The English present/past perfect constructions do mark the perfect, though "perfect" is a bit more of a complex mix of tense and aspect than it is pure aspect. The fact that certain syntactic constructions are used here rather than a single affix does not make the aspectual marking here any less "pure".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There actually has historically been some debate over how Esperanto participles mark aspect when used in complex tenses. Zamenhof himself saw Esperanto participles as marking a mixture of tense and aspect, and this resulted in a divide among Esperantists regarding whether to translate, say "The house was built long ago" with &lt;em&gt;estis konstruata&lt;/em&gt; (because the participle happens at the same time as the main verb) or with &lt;em&gt;estis konstruita&lt;/em&gt; (as the building is accomplished and focused on describing its result). The latter group largely won out with an un-official notice from the Academy in 1965, which gave the following positions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Esperanto tense system consists of but three tenses: the present, the past, and the future.    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All other time relationships (such as the pluperfect, future perfect, etc. of many other languages) are expressed by adverbs, conjunctions, or simply by context.    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The six participles, used either with nouns or with the verb esti, show aspect, not tense. They show, in other words, in what phase of the action the subject finds himself with respect to the object: whether beginning and unfinished (-ant, -at), finished and fulfilled (-int, -it), or not yet begun but intended or awaited (-ont, -ot).   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accordingly the forms with -ata focus upon the duration or repetition of the act, and the forms with -ita focus upon the result of the act. The forms with -ita can also show priority in time in the event that there is separate evidence of that in the sentence, such as a word like jam = “already.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Quoted from &lt;a href="http://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/eo/colloq/colloq200.html#sec20-2" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Being Colloquial in Esperanto's Appendix on Participles&lt;/a&gt;, which goes into more detail about the conflict here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this treatment of Esperanto participles are markers exclusively of aspect is technically not an official order from the Academy, it has generally been treated as such my most Esperantists, and this is largely how Esperantists use participles -- the &lt;em&gt;-anta/-ata&lt;/em&gt; participles marking the continuous/progressive, the &lt;em&gt;-inta/-ita&lt;/em&gt; participles marking the resultative, and the &lt;em&gt;-onta/-ota&lt;/em&gt; participles marking the prospective. This is consistent with how they're used outside of the complex tenses as well. Based on this, one would have to willfully ignore a lot of Esperanto usage and convention to claim its participles &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; mark aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the obvious aspect marking on the participles, it should also be noted a few other affixes mark what could be considered aspect. You've mentioned &lt;em&gt;ek-&lt;/em&gt; as a marker of inchoative aspect yourself (it could also be said to mark the momentane). &lt;em&gt;-iĝ-&lt;/em&gt; could also be said to have some inchoative flavor to it (though it's a bit more obscured among its other functions, consider that &lt;em&gt;eksidi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sidiĝi&lt;/em&gt; are near-synonymous), and &lt;em&gt;-ad-&lt;/em&gt; similarly can mark something like continuative or iterative aspect. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In English, there is a little dot over small letters of i and j. I am not sure what that dot signifies to - pronunciation or sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Gujarati, Hindi and Sanskrit languages, there happens to be dot over letters which signifies to sound "&lt;em&gt;-n&lt;/em&gt;" for example &lt;em&gt;Ganga&lt;/em&gt; written in either of three with dot over "&lt;em&gt;Ga&lt;/em&gt;" alphabet sounds "&lt;em&gt;Gan&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any importance altogether to have such notations? Why? How do you add the same while devising grammar rules for a constructed language? &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;You are the one who constructs the writing system, so it is your choice whether you assign some "meaning" to dots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are constructed scripts with dots carrying some meaning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengwar" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Tengwar&lt;/a&gt; one, two or three dots above a consonant denote different vowels following that consonant (there some other markers for more vowels)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.terjemar.net/kelen/writing.php" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Kelen&lt;/a&gt; a dot below a vowel denotes the length of the vowel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently not aware of a constructed scripts where some dots are just part of certain letters (like in the Latin alphabet &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;j&lt;/em&gt;) without adding information to a dotless base form.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In English, the dot does not carry meaning. It's just part of the lower case letters &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;j.&lt;/em&gt; There is no dotless base form. Note that the letters &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;j&lt;/em&gt; aren't dotted in every font or variant of the Latin alphabet. Notably, there is no dot in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_type" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Gaelic type&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish, on the other hand, does distinguish between dotless &lt;em&gt;I/ı&lt;/em&gt; (representing the phoneme /ɯ/) and dotted &lt;em&gt;İ/i&lt;/em&gt; (/i/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the tittle was added to improve legibility. In &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter#Textualis" rel="noreferrer"&gt;late medieval blackletter&lt;/a&gt;, the letters &lt;em&gt;i, m, n,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;u&lt;/em&gt; were basically all made up of vertical strokes, &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; basically was &lt;em&gt;ııııııııııııııı.&lt;/em&gt; So a dot was added to &lt;em&gt;i:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;ıııiııiıııııııı.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dots can be used for a variety of purposes: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuktitut_syllabics" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Inuktitut syllabics&lt;/a&gt; (a constructed script for a natural language) use dots to indicate vowel length, while the Hebrew abjad uses them as vowel marks (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqqud" rel="noreferrer"&gt;niqqud&lt;/a&gt;), so does &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengwar" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Tengwar&lt;/a&gt;. In Arabic, they are used to distinguish letters that have come to otherwise look identical (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_diacritics#I%E2%80%98j%C4%81m_(phonetic_distinctions_of_consonants)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;i‘jām&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dots are an easy way to derive one symbol from another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As jknappen has already said: it's up to you what you want to use dots for in your script or if you want to use them at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thing you might want to consider is the medium your script is supposed to be written on. Dots can be easily produced with ink on paper but they are harder to carve in wood where you might want to use a short line instead. Of course, if it is meant to be mainly printed or displayed by screens, reproducibility is much less of a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;When designing some of my recent attempts at languages, I've used a list of Proto-Indo-European roots (taken from &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:List_of_Proto-Indo-European_roots" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Looking at the verbs covered by those roots, you get a good list of verbs which would be important to a pre-literate culture. So while you get verbs like "to paint" (since slapping colour on things is rather old) or "to shop/trade" you don't get verbs like "to write" or "to read".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is somewhat culturally biased: someone living in other parts of the world without domesticated animals is unlikely to need a verb for "to domesticate/tame", while the plains/steppe dwelling PIE culture didn't need a verb to describe a long crossing over water ("to sail"), whereas someone from a culture in the South Pacific would. Still, it's a good place to start because it gives you functional verbs that a human society is more than likely to have.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I think, the more generic a term is, the better you can use a known term in your native language. The more specific a term is, the greater is the need for some circumlocution or some conlang term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples:&lt;/strong&gt; Specific kinds of flowers and trees in Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" have constructed names like &lt;em&gt;mallorn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;niphedril&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;simbelmyne&lt;/em&gt;. He consistently used &lt;em&gt;pipe-weed&lt;/em&gt; (the word &lt;em&gt;tobacco&lt;/em&gt; is used by the narrator, but not in dialogues). Already on the level of genera, Tolkien uses terms like &lt;em&gt;pine tree&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;oak&lt;/em&gt;, ... and of course there is &lt;em&gt;grass&lt;/em&gt;, there are &lt;em&gt;trees&lt;/em&gt;, there are &lt;em&gt;horses&lt;/em&gt; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you want to call some space creatures "cows" depends on the picture the word "cow" evokes and the uses of cows (Do they give milk and flesh? Can you use oxen for ploughing or driving a cart?) in your fictional culture.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Dots (and diacritics generally) have been used in writing systems for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To mark vowels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In abjads and some abugidas, consonants are written as large characters, and vowels are written as diacritics around the main characters, frequently a dot or dots, but also dashes and other small marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option for a con-writing system which I haven't seen before would be to swap this, and have the vowels be the main characters, and the consonants be indicated by diacritics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound modifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diacritics are used in some writing systems to indicate some sort of sound modification, such as voicing, lenition/fortition (turning a stop into a fricative or vice versa), vowel length, or tone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To increase the character inventory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a language borrows a script from another language, it might not have enough characters for all of its phonemes. One common option is to use diacritics to make more characters. This is common when languages adapt the Latin script, such as in French or Vietnamese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or because of language change, the writing system may no longer be adequate if new phonemes arise. One option is to add a mark to an existing character. (This is probably actually the origin of all of French's diacritics.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To improve legibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diacritics can be used to improve legibility, which is the origin of the dot of "i" and "j". Some languages also use diacritics to distinguish homophones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To mark syllables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diaereses is used to indicate that two adjacent vowels are to be pronounced separately, as in the name &lt;em&gt;Noël&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a complete list. The Wikipedia page for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic" rel="noreferrer"&gt;diacritics&lt;/a&gt; gives a thorough look at what writing systems for conlangs use them for. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;My constructed language has 26 English letters and 30 special characters (plus four different accent marks.) The characters are slightly abstract. The closest I've gotten to producing them is with LaTeX/MathJax (Which offers a  wide enough range to produce most of them.) As I go along building vocab/conjugation lists, I've hit a roadblock where I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to write a word down, but it has a symbol in it that I can't reproduce well on whatever sticky note app (or Word!) that I'm using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any good platform for me to be able to build these lists on, or do I have to do it on paper?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Well, LaTeX is a great platform for writing anything, and you already seem to use it to some success. So I suggest using LaTeX and creating pdf out of it for distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What helps in the long run is creating a font with all the special characters for your conlang. TeX and LaTeX come with a reasonably usable font creation program called METAFONT, but the so created fonts are only usable in the TeX universe—which may be sufficient for you. I have successfully created fonts with METAFONT, and on our partner stackexchange &lt;a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/"&gt;https://tex.stackexchange.com/&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of people that are willing to help with METAFONT.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Note that a break down of concepts according to part-of-speech (like verb, noun, adjective, adverb, etc.) does not generalise well over the languages of the world. The amount of verbs—whatever you define them, anyway—can vary to a large degree in natural languages, and adjectives may be completely absent (their role being taken over either by verbs [like the apple reds] or by nouns [the apple's redness]). So asking for a list of verbs already introduces some bias (wanted or unwanted, depending on your design goals) into your conlang design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore quite understandable that such lists don't exist.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a human culture that gradually develops an underwater civilisation. They still require mouth and nose breathing and will be living in air bubbles, retaining traditional phones. They do spend &lt;em&gt;a lot of time&lt;/em&gt; swimming around and I want them to be able to communicate through water as well. Modified and new underwater phones will develop over time etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I'm interested in and haven't been able to find an answer to is, of our &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; available phones, which ones can be made, heard and understood underwater?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let's work off the idea that there is no breathing equipment in the way of these vocalisations. Free diving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I start constructing modified sounds and augmentations etc &lt;em&gt;I would like to know what I can keep of our current soundbank.&lt;/em&gt; What do I have to throw out completely. I may ask a later question on constructing/modifying new sounds for underwater languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I understand that humans hearing underwater is affected by bone conduction, skipping the first 2 ear bones. We will be able to hear much higher frequencies and from further away, although direction will be hard to discern. I'm still reading up on all of these features but just wanted to say I was aware of these various facts. For the purpose of this question, I'm just focused on using current known sounds underwater.&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;From reading the answers to the Worldbuilding SE you reference, I would draw the following conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;anything unvoiced goes out of the window. So no /f/, /p/, /k/, /t/, /s/ etc. They are pretty useless, as they are predominantly in the higher frequency ranges (especially the fricatives) or very short and without much energy (which would be provided by the glottis). And higher frequency sounds travel less well in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;consonants in general are either short (plosives) or prefer higher frequency bands (fricatives), so apart from /r/ and /l/ (and possibly /v/, /z/) would not carry well underwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;vowels seem best suited. And looking at the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_diagram" rel="noreferrer"&gt;frequency characteristics&lt;/a&gt;, those with lower &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant" rel="noreferrer"&gt;formants&lt;/a&gt; seem slightly preferable, so /u/ and /o/, and the back /a/: vowels produced at the back of the vocal tract. The fronted vowels (/i/, /e/, frontal /a/) would have a higher frequency component again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in summary I would think a vowel-based phoneme inventory might be best. This inventory could be supplemented by some &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximant_consonant" rel="noreferrer"&gt;approximants&lt;/a&gt; (/l/, /r/, /j/, and /w/). Which is weird, as consonants usually carry most information in natural language! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whch s wrd, s cnsnnts sll crr mst nfrmtn n ntrl lngg!&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I would recommend using a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration" rel="noreferrer"&gt;transliteration&lt;/a&gt; into ASCII or something similar which can be more universally used if the correct font is not available. For example, Esperanto uses some uncommon diacritics (ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, and ŭ), which are not always available. As a result people write them by using the letter 'x' which is not used in Esperanto: &lt;em&gt;cx&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;gx&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ux&lt;/em&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using digraphs or trigraphs you should be able to represent your extra characters; another option would be to append digits, as in &lt;em&gt;a1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;a2&lt;/em&gt; for different variants of the letter &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your system is unambiguous (like the Esperanto convention), then you can easily convert between it and a proper representation including all the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: in German, the umlaut characters are often represented by appending an 'e': &lt;em&gt;ü&lt;/em&gt; becomes &lt;em&gt;ue&lt;/em&gt;. This is not unambiguous, as there are valid combinations of &lt;em&gt;u&lt;/em&gt; followed by &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; which are not &lt;em&gt;ü&lt;/em&gt;; an automatic back-transliteration is not possible. This is something you need to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;My inclination would be to simply create a font for my language's writing system, and then use that font in whatever application I'm using to build my dictionary or text corpus. You can then use e.g., Word's autocorrect or an additional program like AutoHotKey to change easy-to-remember/easy-to-type sequences to the specific character from your font - for example, if your writing system has a glyph for the sound represented in English by the digraph &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, you can set up autocorrect or AHK to change &lt;code&gt;ch&lt;/code&gt; to whatever your glyph is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many font editors out there; the ones that I would recommend at this point (for Windows; I don't do a lot of language development on other systems) would be &lt;a href="https://fontforge.github.io/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;FontForge&lt;/a&gt; or any of FontLab's font-creation tools (&lt;a href="https://old.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;TypeTool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://old.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontographer/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Fontographer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;FontLab Studio&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-vi/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;FontLab VI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, someone on reddit tried to test this experimentally (using a bathtub). Here’s what they found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vowels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, these were the hardest to distinguish (at least personally). &lt;strong&gt;The most striking vowels were /æ, i, u/&lt;/strong&gt;. /a, o, ɑ, ɒ, ɔ/ all seemed to blend together, losing distinction. The same happened to
    close-mid and open-mid center vowels as they too blurred. The front
    close vowels also blurred, as did the back close and close-mid vowels.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tone&lt;/strong&gt; definitely helped to distinguish sounds, and you can really play with vowel length. It's eerie to hear your voice carry underwater
    and not dissipate as quickly. You can also factor in &lt;strong&gt;uvular trilled
    vowels&lt;/strong&gt;. With tone these sound very unique. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consonants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found it most easy to distinguish &lt;strong&gt;/p, t, k/&lt;/strong&gt; from their ejective counterparts, but &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; voiced /b, d, k/. Like the vowels, &lt;strong&gt;most of
    the fricatives (labial, dental, and alveolar) blurred&lt;/strong&gt; together. You
    can distinguish this amorphous group against /ts'/. &lt;strong&gt;Retroflex
    fricatives merged with /tʃ/ and /dʒ/&lt;/strong&gt;. As you farther back the
    consonants begin to get indistinguishable from vowels. The other
    consonants followed suit, at least to my ears. &lt;strong&gt;Nasals were all
    identical&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Clicks were not possible&lt;/strong&gt;, unless you want to inhale
    and choke on water.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/6n1zpn/i_stuck_my_head_in_a_bathtub_to_piece_together_a/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;reddit post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now of course this isn’t exactly hard science, as it’s all based on the perception and articulatory skill of one person. Still, it provides intersting data.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I found it most easy to distinguish &lt;strong&gt;/p, t, k/&lt;/strong&gt; from their ejective counterparts, but &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; voiced /b, d, k/. Like the vowels, &lt;strong&gt;most of
    the fricatives (labial, dental, and alveolar) blurred&lt;/strong&gt; together. You
    can distinguish this amorphous group against /ts'/. &lt;strong&gt;Retroflex
    fricatives merged with /tʃ/ and /dʒ/&lt;/strong&gt;. As you farther back the
    consonants begin to get indistinguishable from vowels. The other
    consonants followed suit, at least to my ears. &lt;strong&gt;Nasals were all
    identical&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Clicks were not possible&lt;/strong&gt;, unless you want to inhale
    and choke on water.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now of course this isn’t exactly hard science, as it’s all based on the perception and articulatory skill of one person. Still, it provides intersting data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;No, even among natlangs there are no true universal sounds. The closest would a low /a/ type vowel, which 98%+ of natlangs do have, &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arapaho_language#Phonology" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;but not all&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this is in terms of phonemes, not allophones. Other very common phones include the stops [p/b], [t/d], and [k/g], as well as one or more nasals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating a conlang, a minimum of two to three vowel phonemes or three consonant phonemes (with more consonants if there are few vowels and vice versa) would be expected for a naturalistic phonology. The natlangs with the smallest phoneme inventories have on the order of around ten to twelve phonemes, however analyses of such languages are usually controversial. Such languages also often have tone or phonemic length, which does make it harder to compare languages and harder to come to consensus on what should count as 'smallest'.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Most if not all phonemes in a language will share something with at least 2 other consonants. For example, if a language has a plosive, then it'll probably have several. Likewise, if it has a voiced plosive, it'll probably have other voiced consonants, possibly of other points of articulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this just the majority of the time. English, for instance has only one palatal consonant (the 'y' sound) and only one lateral (our 'l'). Though few languages have more than one lateral consonant (assuming they have any at all), and 'y' is the only common palatal consonant. All the others are rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, however, a few universals. All languages have voiceless stops. They may only have one (and there are that do), but they will always have one. Also, all languages have monophthongs. So that means that there aren't any natural language out there that only have diphthongs for vowels. Note however, that diphthongs in a language can be made up of monophthongs that don't exist in the language. Take note that the English 'o' sound is actually a diphthong. English doesn't have the monophthong 'o' for some reason. This is why books that teach you foreign languages often tell you cut off the last part of the 'o' sound. What they're actually trying to get you to do is not do the off-glide that our 'o' normally has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that though, there are no universals. No one phone is found in all languages. And exactly how many phonemes a language has varies widely. The most common is 5 vowels (the standard 5-vowel array you see everywhere) and 20 to 25 consonants. But there's languages with only half a dozen consonants, and others that have dozens. Then there's the case of Ubykh, which not only has dozens of consonants but only contains 2 vowels, which are of course prone to considerable allophony. In general, its hard to find languages that have fewer than 5 vowels, but they do exist. Several native languages up in Canada only have 4 vowels. The Semitic languages only have 3 vowels (well, modern Arabic also has 2 diphtongs, and its three monophthongs distinguish length, though classical Arabic only had 3 monophthongs, I don't know about Hebrew).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A lot of languages, both natural and constructed, mark things like part of speech, gender/noun class, tense, and what not with suffixes. But what about prefixes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that would make more sense for a head-first language. But the issue with just adding vowels to the beginning of all words makes things look repetitive, and also adds an additional syllable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative would be to have the initial consonant instead be a prefix. Though this would mean that every root in the language would have to start with a vowel (unless the language was very liberal with initial consonant clusters).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know of any language that does this. Its common for languages to have the rhyme of a word mean something, but I've never heard of the onset of the word meaning anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, I'm aware of the 'consonant mutations' of the Celtic languages, but those are triggered by agreement. They can't indicate anything on their own, as far as I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying that all conlangs have to be like natlangs, but in my experience, there's some things that languages do where there's a very good practical reason why they do them. If you come up with something that no natlang does, there may be a good reason for that. Humans for example seem to favor placing the subject of the sentence at the beginning. If you say try to place the verb first, you end up with a lot of weird problems. Of course, there are verb-initial languages, but they're rare and tend to feature very exotic grammars (Tagalog comes to mind).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Many languages mark things like those you mention at the beginning of a word. Noun class in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language#Noun_classes" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Swahili&lt;/a&gt; and the other Bantu languages comes to mind. It doesn't require all roots to begin with a vowel; the prefixes also include vowels (as in &lt;em&gt;Ki&lt;/em&gt;swahili).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian has prepositions (not prefixes) such as в, which are pronounced as part of the onset of the following word (and it does sometimes cause initial consonant clusters), in addition to case. There's no reason why a conlang couldn't have the same as a prefix for gender, case or tense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also want to look at the WALS chapters &lt;a href="http://wals.info/chapter/26" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Prefixing vs. Suffixing in Inflectional Morphology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://wals.info/chapter/51" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Position of Case Affixes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://wals.info/chapter/69" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Position of Tense-Aspect Affixes&lt;/a&gt; for lists of languages that have these features as prefixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case I wish to see about making a hybrid 15th century Aztec-Chinese Hybrid language. (I know its not realistic)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking that the influence of a Chinese Empire in exile in the Americas would influence Aztec to take on the simplification of their character to be more based on simple strokes like chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I.e. Chinese began as pictographs that evolved into today's simple stroke based script, Would Aztecs combine Chinese symbols with their own, adapt theirs to be more chinese?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubt the influence of Aztecs would inspire Chinese to have more complicated and colorized pictographs&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The obvious comparison to make here is to Japanese, as it's a real-life hybrid script and is currently the only non-Chinese language to use them. However, it's important to consider that Japanese did not have an existing writing system when Chinese characters were brought over, and for quite a while the Japanese elites wrote strictly in Classical/Literary Chinese, even after the evolution of hiragana (which were more often used by women). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that you have actual Chinese people in this exiled empire you describe, they will almost certainly be writing in Literary Chinese but speaking some form of vernacular (the specifics of which will depend upon where in China they've come from), so it's possible that Chinese characters will be repurposed to write Nahuatl, particularly if the Chinese become the dominant group in the area. Or it's possible that the opposite will happen, particularly if the Aztecs are the dominant group, and the Chinese will begin to write their language (be it Literary Chinese or their spoken vernacular) using the Aztec script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of the Chinese script influencing the Aztec script but the opposite not being likely seems to be based on some misplaced ideas about simpler characters being inherently better and more likely to catch on -- which script becomes dominant is more likely to be influenced by the sociopolitics of this situation rather than any inherent qualities of the script. Also be sure to keep in mind that different scripts are better for different writing materials -- will the Chinese be able to continue to produce the kinds of paper, ink, and brushes they're used to in the Americas? These are the sorts of things you need to research, ponder, and decide for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

Also be sure to keep in mind that different scripts are better for different writing materials -- will the Chinese be able to continue to produce the kinds of paper, ink, and brushes they're used to in the Americas? These are the sorts of things you need to research, ponder, and decide for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I want to design a mildly weird phonology with the following features&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not particularly difficult to pronounce for speakers of average European languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling somewhat unnatural or weird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weirdness should be noticeable (like the OSV word order in Klingon is). It may include statistical effects (some phones are used more frequent than others thereby producing the effect of weirdness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What techniques can I use to achieve this effect?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;You should start with consonants, I don't think you can make a vowel inventory as weird as a consonant inventory (maybe complex tones? creaky voice?). After that, it depends on your opinion of "particularly difficult" and "unnatural and weird".&lt;br&gt;
 - Click consonants can be easy enough if you don't overdo it (more like Bantu languages/Damin and less like Khoisan languages, so only the simple ones).&lt;br&gt;
 - Retroflex consonants are also not very European and sufficiently easy to pronounce, but maybe not noticeably weird.&lt;br&gt;
 - Ejectives and implosives are similar, but much more noticeable.&lt;br&gt;
 - Linguolabials sound and look weird (especially the trill) and are very easy to produce. Same goes for bilabial trill.&lt;br&gt;
 - Prenasalization, unclosed plosives and similar modifications are non-European (I don't know much about their ease of pronunciation).&lt;br&gt;
 - You could go with something like Kaybop and have manual percussives (Kaybop has clap [bimanual percussive] and facepalm [faciomanual percussive]), which is very unnatural (maybe a bidigital percussive?). These are weird no matter what you say. Also from Kaybop: Phonemic hats.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klingon frequently uses velar and uvular voiceless sounds, which gives it its typical Klingonyness. You can also remove areas of the IPA (note that it is unadviced to just remove certain sounds), where you can choose randomly from removing all voiced, voiceless, labials, alveolars, velars, plosives, fricatives and so on, or make phonemes from any area noticeably more frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are phonotactics. Many European languages have consonant clusters, so a syllable structure like CV or CVC has an exotic feeling (just look at Austronesian languages like Hawai'i). Ithkuil on the other side is weird because it has so many consonants (and vowels) and very complex clusters.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concludes my advices, but there are probably many more things fitting your description.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;What are examples of International Auxiliary Languages (IALs) created and promoted in the 21st century?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware that many people think that Esperanto and Interlingua are in some sense "the last word" on International Auxiliary Languages and that other projects have no realistic chance in succeeding against the established ones. This does not prevent authors to invent new conlangs purposed as IALs, and I like to hear of recent projects fulfilling this criterion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am only interested in projects that are worked out to a certain degree, including a grammar, a sketch of derivational morphology, a substantial word list, and some sample texts. Mere conlang stubs don't qualify as answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The target group should be really international, conlangs designed for specific subgroups (like interslavic or intergermanic languages) don't count.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Lojban is an example. It hasn't been created in the 21st century, but it still has a very active community, and its grammar is specified thoroughly. Of course, it has weaknesses for IALs like a distinction between labial and rhotic consonant and a five-vowel system, but it is much less eurocentric than Esperanto and Interlingua.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The only legit example from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globish_(Nerri%C3%A8re)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nerrière's Globish&lt;/a&gt; (2004) and  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interslavic_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Interslavic&lt;/a&gt; (2006). Both of these fail OP's criteria, since they are specific to one language branch. Other instances either predate 2000 (Kotava, Lingua Franca Nova), or were not intended as auxlangs (Lojban) or both (Toki Pona). To these, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_constructed_languages#Auxiliary_languages" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_constructed_languages#Auxiliary_languages&lt;/a&gt; adds &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambahsa" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sambahasa&lt;/a&gt; (2007) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingwa_de_planeta" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lingwa de planeta&lt;/a&gt; (2010), both of which pass OP's criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the Interslavic wikipedia page says that "the language" dates from 1665—but what that actually means is the first Slavic-based auxlang, rather than Interslavic (initially Slovianski-N), which was created by Jan van Steenbergen in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The Wikipedia page is also confusing in that it discusses the multiple variants of Slovianski and preceding and subsequent efforts together, rather than highlighting the lineage of the language now labelled Interslavic. But since work is ongoing to unify all those variants, that confusion is not surprising.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are generally a lot fewer vowels than consonants in the phoneme inventory of human languages. That means, with fewer sounds you need to make the words a lot longer if you want to have a decent-sized vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, vowel pronunciation is more varied. There aren't many different ways to pronounce /t/ or /k/, but any regional dialect will change vowels. Partly because there are no fixed places of articulation: vowels are distinguished by the opening of the jaw and the position of the tongue. Both of these are almost infinitely variable compared to closing your lips and releasing them (as you'd do for a /p/ or a /b/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, why would you disregard most potential sounds that the human vocal apparatus can produce? It's just not an efficient use of your anatomy. A bit like hopping on one leg instead of walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the two main arguments against a vowel-only language are size of phoneme inventory and variability of vowel pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A vowel-only language is surely constructable (and I think, learnable, too), but I am afraid that it will be instable against evolutionary pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vowel sequences like /aua/ or /aia/ tend to develop into glides /awa/ and /aja/ giving raise to the first consonants in the language, and at the hiat between two vowel a third consonant, the glottal stop, may materialise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efficiency of the coding is also a concern, maybe tones can take over the role of consonants in creating more different syllables from the vowels.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Info&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conlang uses verb conjugations &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; in the present tense. To indicate other tenses (preterite/past imperfect/subjunctive/future/etc) I use the combined phrase "sona," meaning "in (the) time (of)" and then adding a various suffix to indicate the specific tense("sonasato"="in time past"). This means I only have the present tense of conjugations per verb, not changing the actions of the subject per tense. (In English, you have "I eat" (present) and "I ate" (past), as one example. In my conlang, you use "In the time of past, I eat." (Past, but using a present conjugation.) What I'm wondering about are the places where I should put this simple tense indicator in a sentence. The conlang's sentence structure is like this (using an example from English as translation):
English:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dog drank from a bowl of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dog(determiner+noun)-&gt; drinks (conjugated verb, "it drinks") from (preposition) a bowl (determiner+noun) of (preposition) water (noun). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my conlang, you would say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sepyew ("(it) drinks", conjugated form of "to drink" in present tense) eu bítõe (the dog) de è roum (from a bowl, this would be contracted into "dè roum" or "dèroum.") de aqua (of water.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, however, was the present tense. The past tense (The dog &lt;em&gt;drank&lt;/em&gt; from a bowl of water) involves the "sonasato"(in the past tense)  in some form, but I don't know where the most logical place to place it would be. Ordinarily, that wouldn't present a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my conlang has no punctuation, that is to say, sentences are one long string of words. I've not considered how to handle this with dialogue, but otherwise it hasn't presented a problem until now.  Pauses for breath within conversation are natural, but I'm &lt;strong&gt;addressing this question from the written aspect of language&lt;/strong&gt;. Because the sentences are fluid, I don't know how to handle the abrupt changes between tenses other than using the "sona" variants excessively. And the rules of the language mean that the tense is always expressed, per statement (not sentence, because of the punctuation) by either ignoring the sona rule (indicating the present tense) or by using it (to indicate some other tense.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Question&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping that in mind, what would be the most logical place to place the tense indicator so that I can change it relatively easily between tenses in a language with no periods or commas (pauses), and where?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;h1&gt;Info&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conlang uses verb conjugations &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; in the present tense. To indicate other tenses (preterite/past imperfect/subjunctive/future/etc) I use the combined phrase "sona," meaning "in (the) time (of)" and then adding a various suffix to indicate the specific tense("sonasato"="in time past"). This means I only have the present tense of conjugations per verb, not changing the actions of the subject per tense. (In English, you have "I eat" (present) and "I ate" (past), as one example. In my conlang, you use "In the time of past, I eat." (Past, but using a present conjugation.) What I'm wondering about are the places where I should put this simple tense indicator in a sentence. The conlang's sentence structure is like this (using an example from English as translation):
English:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dog drank from a bowl of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dog(determiner+noun)-&gt; drinks (conjugated verb, "it drinks") from (preposition) a bowl (determiner+noun) of (preposition) water (noun). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my conlang, you would say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sepyew ("(it) drinks", conjugated form of "to drink" in present tense) eu bítõe (the dog) de è roum (from a bowl, this would be contracted into "dè roum" or "dèroum.") de aqua (of water.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;rsquo;s your conlang, you can put it wherever you think is best&amp;mdash;but my inclination would be immediately adjacent to the verb it applies to. Your sentence structure seems to be VSO, so my initial inclination is to place it immediately &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the verb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your sample sentence, &lt;em&gt;Sepyew sonsato eu bítõe de è roum de aqua.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the translation of a sentence like "The truck carried the food Joe ate", you would need two tense indicators, one for each verb: "it-carry past-tense the truck [he-eat past-tense Joe the food] sentence-as-object-indicator". If only one verb is in a non-present tense (The truck carries the food Joe ate), you apply the tense indicator to the verb that is in the non-present tense:"it-carry  the truck [he-eat past-tense Joe the food] sentence-as-object-indicator".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The past tense marker you constructed, &lt;em&gt;sonasato&lt;/em&gt;, is a rather long element. Applying the rule "short before long" this would indicate that you put it even after the objects, like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sepyew eu bítõe dèroum de aqua sonasato&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example it becomes the last element in the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The most prominent positions in a sentence are the beginning and end, and so those positions are frequently used to indicate &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_structure" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the information structure&lt;/a&gt; of a sentence. A word carrying grammatical markers is not very prominent, but there is actually a common position for unprominent words: second position, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Wackernagel" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wackernagel's position&lt;/a&gt;, named after the linguist who identified the pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many languages, both with free word order and those with tighter syntaxes, the second position of a sentence is where grammatically important but non-emphasised words are found. Second position usually refers to it coming after a complete constituent (so it could be a word or a phrase), but in some languages it may mean it comes literally after the first word, even if that would split up a phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Let's look at some real world situations of contact of writing systems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happens that a few characters from another writing system are borrowed into an existing writing system. Examples include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latin borrowing the letter Y and Z from Greek&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koptic: Basically a Greek alphabet with 6 character borrowed from Demotic Egyptian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Icelandic: Borrowing þ from Germanic runes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a writing system is just restyled after a foreign writing system, an example is the reformation of the Cyrillic script by Peter the Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, several writing systems coexist and form a complex mixed writing system. This is the case in South Korea and Japan, where Chinese characters are mixed with either Hangul or Hiragana and Katakana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can pick from this list what you like most.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Probably the best technique is making the language weird by absence. Instead of giving the language weird phonemes, make it lack the most common phonemes. A language with 5 vowels but no /a/, /i/ or /u/. A language with several consonants, but no /p/, /t/, or /k/. Or totally without bilabials. Or with no stops.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Well, there is always &lt;a href="https://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solresolo" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Solresol&lt;/a&gt;, which has several isomorphic representations, and some of those could be considered vowel-only (depending on the instrument used).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For natlangs, there are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistled_language" rel="noreferrer"&gt;whistled languages&lt;/a&gt;, with a very reduced consonant inventory. They could fit your criteria especially if you consider tones to be a feature of vowels, and look at the phonetic level - consonants are realized mostly by glides and occlusion (phonemically, consonants are copied from the spoken language &amp; reduced).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Human beings first develop with a sense of Self and not being able to distinguish between "Self" and "The World". Things are seen as "Images" and "Objects", only later are abstract ideas understood. Human languages started off as SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) but later changed to different word orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, these features would make it easier to learn languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common Phonemes (/m/, /k/, /i/, /a/, /j/, /p/, /u/, /w/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Consonant Clusters ( mk, mp, kp, pk)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noun based (let verbs and adjectives derived from nouns)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let any complex words have it's root from the simple (For Example:  "Hospital" could be "Health-House" or "Healing Place").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like human beings start of learning simple things, then complex, let all "big" words be form from compounds of smaller ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember language Universals. Frontal vowels (/i/) are usually used in words that represent smallness, sharpness, brightness, closeness, and hapiness. The sound /i/ uses the same muscles as when a human being smiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back vowels (/u/) are usually used in words that represent bigness, depth, roundness, smoothness, darkness, dirtiness, far-distance, and gloominess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toki Pona has some of the features of what an easy language would look like. Good luck to inventing an easy/minimalist language. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In the conlang "Ro", each letter represents a specific thing. The first letter is a clue to the meaning of the rest of the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gebrac means an inch, and the first syllable "ge" means measurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;radac means boy, and the first syllable "ra" means person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial consonant can therefore change the meaning since each letter has a meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;rebec means think,
ribec means remember, but 
zibec means repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Esperanto has a literature (both original and translated) including criminal stories. Criminals are often portrayed as speaking some slang, so my question is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does criminal slang looks like in Esperanto?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The only auxlang I've heard of being made by a Japanese person is Noxilo, but that's a modern invention. To my knowledge, the original creator is still alive. Noxilo is just a word-for-word cipher of Japanese btw. Even the phoneme inventory and orthography is clearly Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;This question is different than the previous one titled “&lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/566/which-features-make-a-language-easier-to-learn"&gt;Which features make a language easier to learn?&lt;/a&gt;” in that I'm not interested in making it easy for L1 learners. For them learning the language spoken by their society is an inevitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I'm interested in making a language that is objectively as easy to learn as possible for people learning it as a second language. And these features should help people regardless of what language they speak natively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems intuitive that there would exist features that would help to create that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, take French or German and remove the genders. This seems like it should make the languages easier to learn without losing any communicative power. Another example would be phonology. If English were to remove the 'th' sound it would be easier for speakers of other languages to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also realize that it may be the case that there just isn’t enough research on this topic to know definitively what features are best for this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It depends very much who your target audience is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easier to learn languages that are similar to your own; as a German speaker, learning English is not that hard, apart from the grammatical features (aspect, for example) that don't really have a German equivalent. It's mainly a matter of learning the huge vocabulary with all its not-quite-but-almost synonyms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same with Esperanto. Grammar is easy, and most of the vocab is not too hard either. Here it's the particles which are the tricky bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently learning Dutch and Swedish, which are both similar to German, in some respects. No big deal. But both Arabic and Korean are a lot harder, and I gave up on Russian. These languages are very different from German, and thus harder for me to learn (the different alphabet is not the issue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klingon is hard for me to learn, because it has a different sentence structure (OVS, as opposed to SVO). If my native language had OVS as well, for example &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apala%C3%AD_language" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Apalaí&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hixkaryana_language" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Hixkaryana&lt;/a&gt;, I think I would find Klingon much easier. Especially since Apalaí is also agglutinative, like Klingon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="http://www.effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty" rel="noreferrer"&gt;list of languages ordered by difficulty&lt;/a&gt; (from the &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/m/fsi/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Foreign Service Institute&lt;/a&gt;). The 'easy' languages are all Indo-European, and the hard ones are Asian/Semitic. You can imagine that the same list produced by a Chinese or Japanese institution would look very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Languages have no 'absolute' difficulty, but only relative. So to answer your question, you can make a language easier to learn for people if you make it more similar to &lt;strong&gt;their&lt;/strong&gt; L1. Which, I guess, is the reason why there is no universal 'easy' language that we all speak...&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;La sociolekta triopo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manuel Halvelik created three sociolects for Esperanto, &lt;a href="https://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcaicam_Esperantom" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Arcaicam Esperantom&lt;/a&gt; (1969), an archaic pre-form of Esperanto, &lt;a href="https://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popido" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Popido&lt;/a&gt; (1973), a constructed dialect of Esperanto, and &lt;a href="https://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavaro" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gavaro&lt;/a&gt; (2006), an argot of Esperanto. &lt;em&gt;Arcaicam Esperantom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Popido&lt;/em&gt; are used in the Esperanto literature, but I don't know a work using &lt;em&gt;Gavaro&lt;/em&gt; (what is not surprising, looking at the publication date of Gavaro).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting feature of Gavaro are the numerals, they are taken from Volapük and are obscure to Esperanto speakers: &lt;em&gt;1 bwal, 2 twel, 3 kwil, 4 fwol, 5 lwel, 6 mwel, 7 vwel, 8 zwul, 9 ĵwel, 10 dweg, 100 twum, 1000 mlat&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I agree with everything Oliver Mason said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: After some more thought...for easiness that is only easy when in the presence of a first language, the question has the answer, which is: languages most similar to your first language. Otherwise, an easy language is an easy language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd add that there is something to be said for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small languages&lt;/strong&gt;, which have most content word classes are closed. In English, only function word classes, like prepositions are closed. When people are working from a small known set of words (or morphemes), sometime the lexemes they create are transparent and their meaning can be guessed. This reduces the burden of memorizing 7000-12000 words (or lexemes-- depending on the linguist, word count accounting can vary).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smallness also applies to grammar- the fewer rules, the easier to learn, albeit at a cost of expressiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples would be toki pona and Esperanto before the community began bulk importing of loan words from French, et al.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creole-like&lt;/strong&gt;.
Creole languages tend to have certain predictable features that in part are explainable because they were spoken by communities that can't be bothered to learn the complex parts of the six languages in the community. Languages like this are more likely to be SVO, analytic, simplified and smaller, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;You may want to look into getting Fontlab or Fontographer. You can design your fonts in Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator and import them into the font software. From there, create ligatures that can do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing about ligatures is that in a search, you can search for the individual letters. For instance, if you use "æ" for "ae" then you search for "ae" and not the ligature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, there's a learning curve, but it may be better in the long run. Not only will you have your ligatures, but you'll have a font for any texts you create. You can also export to a woff font for web use.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring Easiness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with Oliver that we measure language difficulty based on how hard it is to learn from a given native language. However, I still believe that we can come up with language features that make a language easy to learn in general. To measure this, you would want to take the number of hours it takes to achieve a certain level of proficiency in a target language from 50 source languages (the languages with the most speakers). After this come up with an average by weighting the numbers based on number of speakers. A language with an average of 456 hours would be easier to learn for the average person than a language with an average of 678 hours. This is of course not a method of deriving 'absolute' difficulty but it's good enough for what I want. Now, actually running this experiment would take a lot of time but for now it's good as a thought experiment to figure out what the goal is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phonology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to get the sounds right in a new language can be very time consuming. To counteract this an easy language should use phonemes that are common amongst the world's most spoken languages. As Richard noted in the comments the language Toki Pona has a very simple phonology that would be perfect for this. Toki Pona has nine consonants p, t, k, s, m, n, l, j, w and five vowels a, e, i, o, u. Not only are these very common phonemes but there is also the added benefit that there are no voiced/voiceless pairs. The reason this is useful is because it helps people whose language contains only one of the voiced or voiceless forms of a consonant. As an example, Arabic has no 'p' sound and therefore when they see the world 'pala' in a theoretical easy language they might pronounce it as 'bala'. Since there is no 'b' sound people will recognize that they are saying 'pala'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vocabulary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a vocabulary that everyone would recognize would be useful but it's unfortunately not possible. The best attempts at creating such a vocabulary would only be useful for around 15 percent of the world's population. Add to this the fact that phonology is more important, and using the simplified phonology, you would not even be able to mimic a lot of the vocabulary from a natural language. However, there are still some things that would help make a language's vocabulary easier to learn: avoiding homonyms, making common words short, constructing words to be easy to pronounce (ex. avoiding complex consonant clusters).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been proven that phonetic writing systems are easier to learn than logographic systems. Between phonetic writing systems (alphabet, abugida, abjad) it's less clear what the easier to learn system is. However, it doesn't really matter due to the overwhelming adoption of the Latin script world wide (70% of the world's population use it). Even in places where the native language does not use the Latin script people will still have significant exposure to it. Because of this an easy to learn language should use the Latin script. The words should also be completely phonetic in their spelling. This allows learners to read, pronounce, and spell any word without having to memorize a bunch of spelling rules and exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regularity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is self explanatory. A language that has regular grammar and no exceptions to its grammar rules is easier to learn. This should apply to all forms of grammar (inflections, word order, usages). As an example, if English were to always use -ed to make verbs past tense it would be easier to learn (swimmed, eated, falled).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Unnecessary Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as biological evolution has left human bodies with a large amount of inefficiencies, language evolution has left natural languages with a large amount of inefficiencies. It would take a long time to go through these as there are many, so I'll just use the gender example from the question. As jknappen said in the comments grammatical genders do have a small amount of communicative power in that they can, on occasion, avoid ambiguity of two things. However, this only happens when there are two things potentially being referred to, when it's not clear based on context which thing is being referred to, and when the two things are different genders. Example from Wikipedia: "a flowerbed in the garden which I maintain" vs "ein Blumenbeet im Garten, das ich pflege". This is very rare and not useful enough to merit spending a significant amount of time learning genders.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring Easiness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with Oliver that we measure language difficulty based on how hard it is to learn from a given native language. However, I still believe that we can come up with language features that make a language easy to learn in general. To measure this, you would want to take the number of hours it takes to achieve a certain level of proficiency in a target language from 50 source languages (the languages with the most speakers). After this come up with an average by weighting the numbers based on number of speakers. A language with an average of 456 hours would be easier to learn for the average person than a language with an average of 678 hours. This is of course not a method of deriving 'absolute' difficulty but it's good enough for what I want. Now, actually running this experiment would take a lot of time but for now it's good as a thought experiment to figure out what the goal is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phonology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to get the sounds right in a new language can be very time consuming. To counteract this an easy language should use phonemes that are common amongst the world's most spoken languages. As Richard noted in the comments the language Toki Pona has a very simple phonology that would be perfect for this. Toki Pona has nine consonants p, t, k, s, m, n, l, j, w and five vowels a, e, i, o, u. Not only are these very common phonemes but there is also the added benefit that there are no voiced/voiceless pairs. The reason this is useful is because it helps people whose language contains only one of the voiced or voiceless forms of a consonant. As an example, Arabic has no 'p' sound and therefore when they see the world 'pala' in a theoretical easy language they might pronounce it as 'bala'. Since there is no 'b' sound people will recognize that they are saying 'pala'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vocabulary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a vocabulary that everyone would recognize would be useful but it's unfortunately not possible. The best attempts at creating such a vocabulary would only be useful for around 15 percent of the world's population. Add to this the fact that phonology is more important, and using the simplified phonology, you would not even be able to mimic a lot of the vocabulary from a natural language. However, there are still some things that would help make a language's vocabulary easier to learn: avoiding homonyms, making common words short, constructing words to be easy to pronounce (ex. avoiding complex consonant clusters).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been proven that phonetic writing systems are easier to learn than logographic systems. Between phonetic writing systems (alphabet, abugida, abjad) it's less clear what the easier to learn system is. However, it doesn't really matter due to the overwhelming adoption of the Latin script world wide (70% of the world's population use it). Even in places where the native language does not use the Latin script people will still have significant exposure to it. Because of this an easy to learn language should use the Latin script. The words should also be completely phonetic in their spelling. This allows learners to read, pronounce, and spell any word without having to memorize a bunch of spelling rules and exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regularity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is self explanatory. A language that has regular grammar and no exceptions to its grammar rules is easier to learn. This should apply to all forms of grammar (inflections, word order, usages). As an example, if English were to always use -ed to make verbs past tense it would be easier to learn (swimmed, eated, falled).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Unnecessary Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as biological evolution has left human bodies with a large amount of inefficiencies, language evolution has left natural languages with a large amount of inefficiencies. It would take a long time to go through these as there are many, so I'll just use the gender example from the question. As jknappen said in the comments grammatical genders do have a small amount of communicative power in that they can, on occasion, avoid ambiguity of two things. However, this only happens when there are two things potentially being referred to, when it's not clear based on context which thing is being referred to, and when the two things are different genders.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm constructing an auxlang/artlang &lt;em&gt;(temporarily named Syn)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Syn is (being) designed to interface with any known human language, with a wildly uniform set of simplistic, unambiguous symbols.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have almost finished the phonetic alphabet component and have been trying to transliterate several languages into this while translating some that I know now on the side. However, since I'm not a native speaker of any of the transliterations and google translate is becoming not much of a help, I can't pinpoint the exact phonetic equivalent of some words. Now I'm running out of practice scripts from different spoken languages to accurately transliterate. Hence, I think I'm gonna need another language similar to what I'm making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any languages, written or spoken, natural or constructed, that occupy majority of the entire phonetic alphabet, with as little diacritics, as few ambiguous strokes, and as strict 1-to-1 symbol-phoneme as possible?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;You're gonna have a hard time with "majority of the entire IPA". Non-pulmonic consonants are rare, and some consonants are hard to contrast (e.g. /β/ vs. /v/), while vowels are often highly allophonic. Natural languages tend to have fewer IPA places and distinction via aspiration, labialization, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best answer to your question would be Ithkuil (constructed, almost unspeakable language). It has 58 phonemes, with unusually many vowels (13). This allows it to have mostly single phonemes for morphemes. Ithkuil's Roman transliteration is a bit strange, as some phonemes use diacritics and others have digraphs, but it also has its own script (morpho-phonemic with alphabetic characters).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The process of creating the phonology is described at length in Omar Mubin's PhD thesis "&lt;a href="http://www.bartneck.de/publications/2011/robotInteractionLanguage/OmarMubin-ROILA.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ROILA: RObot Interaction LAnguage&lt;/a&gt;" (available from the &lt;a href="http://roila.org/publications/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;publications page&lt;/a&gt;). It seems to have happened in three stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He determined which phonemes are most common in a number of natural and artificial languages (pp. 17-19). The most common vowels were /i, u, o, a, e/ (in IPA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final set of phonemes he chose included the vowels a, e, i, o and u. He doesn't indicate that the vowels were given in IPA, and indeed he later gives them the IPA values /ae &lt;em&gt;(sic)&lt;/em&gt;, ɛ, ɪ, ɑ, ʌ/ (pp. 22-23).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AA /ɑ/ was later altered to AO /ɔ/ in order to avoid confusion with AE /æ/ (p. 35-36).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only explanation I can give for the incongruity between stage 1 and stage 2 is that he (mistakenly?) put the five vowels /a, e, i, o, u/ into his orthography, but changed their phonetic values to the English orthographic "short" vowels, which are /æ, ɛ, ɪ, ɑ, ʌ/ in American English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that he had to avoid confusion between /æ/ and /ɑ/ (in step 3), but doesn't consider any confusion between /æ/ and /ɛ/ or between /ɔ/ and /ʌ/ seems very English-centric, but which would be very strange from the perspective of Dutch, which doesn't distinguish either pair of phonemes (considering the fact he was doing his research in Holland).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, "American English speakers significantly outperformed other speakers in our setup" (p. 34). They also mention problems with Dutch accents and different regional English accents (p. 86 of &lt;a href="http://roila.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dst.2012.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this document&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I want my language, Syn, to be as precise, efficient, unambiguous, and aesthetic as humanely possible. To do that, I think even the texture, dynamics, rhythm, and the likes should be accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, only Mandarin incorporates changes in intonation corresponding with a different meaning of the same spoken word, but even that can be hard to notice for non-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any other languages that incorporte musical concepts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are, how did people manage to use those concepts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are none yet, will such a language possess an added difficulty when speaking it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine that the native speakers of Syn would be naturally adept in tone recognition, and every conversation would seem like an a capella get-together.&lt;/p&gt;

Some natural languages also have a whistled mode, most notably &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silbo_Gomero" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;El Silbo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirah%C3%A3" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pirahã&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not aware of a language—neither natural nor constructed—that incorporates the concept of rhythm or other musical concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would one conjugate "fhtagn" to get the word derivations "dream", "dreamer", "dreaming".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Lovecraft probably didn't think about grammar, and we certainly don't have enough material to reconstruct one. Could also be like Sindarin, where Tolkien wrote much, but never released any specification of the language. Quote from the threat you linked: "To my knowledge, we only have the transcription in the Latin alphabet" (comment from Sparksbet).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In a previous question about making a language easy to learn as a second language I suggested that grammatical genders have very little usefulness. A couple of people, however, suggested that grammatical genders have more usefulness than I think. Because of this I am interested in hearing about any potential uses for grammatical genders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usefulness can be identified by looking at what happens when the grammatical gender is removed. If the speaker needs to communicate the lost information through other means then the grammatical gender is deemed useful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The generic term for genders is "word classes". In some languages male/female isn't the main way to divide up the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word classes are useful for co-ordination. If a language lacks gender, (or animacy, what have you), then you need some other way to know what adjective goes with what noun, which antecedent a pronoun refers to and so on. A language with lousy coordination might be English, with things like "He saw him hit him with it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They make languages hard for language learners because the semantic relationship between the word classes overtime becomes increasingly arbitrary and creates a lexical burden for language learners, i.e. you just have to memorize the word class for each word. Also, gender marker is obligatory, so you have a high entry cost-- you can't say anything until you work out the genders of the relevant words.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;For any particular language maybe 1-2 to dozens. The best way to find out would be to collect as many writing samples as possible that have been posted to the internet. Pick some arbitrary cut off for what counts as "speaking" the language for length. When I did this for toki pona, there were maybe a few hundred people who could write at least a few paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na'vi and Klingon probably have at least a handful to few dozen each. I don't know of any corpus gathering projects for those languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of people who have purchases learning materials, such as the Klingon dictionary, is thousands of times higher than the number of people who invested the time to learn the language. I look forward so seeing more stats out of Duolingo for the Game of Thrones Languages and Klingon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the acid test of fluency- natives who learned the language from their parents, maybe one or two. (Excluding Esperanto natives- there are a lot of those)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Grammatical gender, along with noun classes, are often used in word derivation. Of course, the more categories you have, the more productive this can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also allow a larger number of 3rd person pronouns, allowing for multiple 3rd persons (or objects) to be referred to simply with pronouns without as much confusion arising as to which pronoun refers to who. Though this is more useful in systems where everything has gender. In English for example, this is only useful in about 20% of cases, because only people can be referred to as he and she (everything else just gets 'it', except for maybe pets). In French however, where every noun is referred to as either he or she, this helps out about 80% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as people have mentioned, gender agreement can help tie nouns and adjectives together, allowing you to put them in any order. Though any form or noun-adjective agreement can accomplish this. Case agreement, for instance, is much more effective at this. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As any linguist (and anyone who knows unrelated languages, probably), not all languages express things the same way. Worse yet, its not possible to express everything logically, so all languages are forced to rely on something arbitrary to express certain concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to find out how other languages do things, but I rarely meet with any success. Most dictionaries I find online assume you already know the language, which of course makes sample sentences useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like the only way to find out how a language does anything is to know it. This means that as a conlanger, its nigh impossible to make a conlang that doesn't in some way resemble the languages you know. This can obviously be quite a problem if you're monolingual, as most Americans are. I'm not monolingual, but even I have a problem avoiding Euro-centrism since the only other language I know well is German. Yeah, German does some things differently, but its not that different from English since the two are closely related. They tend to overlap more often than not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any convenient way to get information on specific things in languages without just having to learn half a dozen unrelated languages?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few concepts (like colour terms or kinship terms) that are regularly studied in linguistic typology and where one can find a lot of publications including high-level overviews including a lot of unrelated languages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most concepts, there is nothing comparable available. Maybe one can find studies (e.g., from translatology) comparing a certain concept in a pair of languages or a small group of languages, but those languages tend to be the well-known big ones (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are well-known and notable differences in speed for natural languages: While a fast language like Spanish is spoken at a speed of about 6–7 syllables per second, a slow language like German, English, or Mandarin is spoken with 3–4 syllables per second. Language speed correlates with the amount of information carried by a syllable: The more information in the syllable, the slower the language speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Toki Pona has only a limited number of very simple syllables, limiting the amount of information that they can carry, and it seems to have a speech community as well: Is it spoken at a fast pace like Spanish (or even faster) in real life? Or is it spoken at a slow pace like English?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Of all the criticisms you see of Volapuk, one the most pervasive is that it can be difficult to parse some of the longer compound words. Which is pretty obvious. With all words being CVCVCVCV... and prefixes being (C)V and suffixes V(C), it stands to reason it could be hard to figure out where the root word is amongst the long list of affixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why doesn't Esperanto have this problem? Is it just because the roots are easy to recognize (if you're already familiar with a western European language)? Or is it that Esperanto has somehow managed to avoid the need to form words with long chains of affixes. If so, why was making long-winded compound words necessary in Volapuk but its hard to find a reason to in Esperanto?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I don't know Volapuk, and I only know the utmost basics of Esperanto. I've never actually used the language at any point in time. But I've seen more examples of affix-heavy words from Volapuk than I have from Esperanto (the only Esperanto example I even know of is 'malsanulejo').&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;What are examples of grammatical cases that are not attested in natural languages, but occur in some conlang?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To qualify here, the conlang should have at least some bit of flesh (e.g., a few consistent texts, either original or translated). Pure sketches of potential cases aren't interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respective_case" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Respective or Dedative&lt;/a&gt; case in Quenya, also called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya_grammar#Noun_declension" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Short Locative"&gt;Short Locative&lt;/a&gt;, is too speculative to be counted here; its attestation is very weak in the available material from J. R. R. Tolkien.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I think the best conlang to look for such cases is Ithkuil. &lt;a href="http://ithkuil.net/04_case.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://ithkuil.net/04_case.html&lt;/a&gt; contains a list of all cases. My [short] research suggests that some of them (e.g. navigative for "noun relative to whose vector, arc, or trajectory of motion an event takes place" or allapsive for "amount of time that expected to pass between the contextual present and the time of a future event") aren't attested in any other well-known language. I may be wrong, but it seems plausible regarding Ithkuil's goal of expressing extensive detail.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Esperanto phonotactics was never as restrictive as Volapük's. Its prefixes (including prepositional prefixes) are mostly not CV but CCV or VC, and its stems often enough begin or end with consonant clusters. So morphological boundaries are often easy to tell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover Esperanto initially avoided stem endings for multisyllabic stems that might be ambiguous with suffixes. Hence &lt;em&gt;banquet&lt;/em&gt; becomes &lt;em&gt;bankedo&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;banketo&lt;/em&gt;, for fear of ambiguity with &lt;em&gt;bank-eto&lt;/em&gt; "little bank".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto initially did pursue agglutinativity aggressively, and I'm not sure that it was less enthusiastic about doing so than Volapük. But &lt;em&gt;malsanulejo&lt;/em&gt; is indeed exceptional for Esperanto.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Metaphors are based on shared cultural understanding. Here is one often quoted example of a metaphor from Shakespeare's &lt;em&gt;As You Like It&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All the world's a stage,
  And all the men and women merely players;
  They have their exits and their entrances ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding this metaphor relies on the concept of 'theatre' being shared among the speakers. If you assume the word for 'stage' exists in your language, then that might indicate that this would be the case. So it depends on the reach of your language. In most cultures that regard themselves as 'civilised' you would probably find that something like theatre and plays exists, so this particular metaphor should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some metaphors can be so specific that even native speakers cannot understand them: &lt;em&gt;He kicked the issue into touch&lt;/em&gt;. Unless you know about rugby, you are likely to not have a clue what the speaker is on about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you cannot really regulate the content of your language, but only vocabulary and syntax, you cannot stop speakers from using metaphors. It is the responsibility of the speaker to make sure they are understood by their target audience, so avoiding metaphors or culture-specific expressions/assumptions is generally a good idea, but it has to come from the speaker, not the designer. And the speaker will probably realise that very quickly when they fail to make themselves understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conlang/auxlang is only a tool -- you cannot control how people use it.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the responsibility of the speaker to make sure they are understood by their target audience, so avoiding metaphors or culture-specific expressions/assumptions is generally a good idea, but it has to come from the speaker, not the designer. And the speaker will probably realise that very quickly when they fail to make themselves understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conlang/auxlang is only a tool -- you cannot control how people use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theoretically&lt;/em&gt; you can eliminate metaphor, yes, but you are working &lt;em&gt;against human nature itself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain metaphors are exceedingly common and embedded in the very grammar of many languages (although their exact expression may vary), so in that regard, avoiding metaphor is extremely difficult because it's somewhat an inherent part of the human psyche. Either you will subconsciously integrate some of it, or your users will inevitably create some. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammaticalization" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Grammaticalization&lt;/a&gt; typically originates directly in widespread metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your etymologies and extended meanings (because even in an auxlang, creating a root for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; meaning is downright &lt;em&gt;exhausting&lt;/em&gt;: there's a reason most auxlangs borrow at least part of their vocabulary!) are usually going to be metaphorical in some ways, whether from real languages or from otehr roots. Indeed, "metaphor" is an example: etymologically, the meaning is "carry over, transfer".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up is good, down is bad, quality is possession (hence the use of "have" for qualities and actions), individuals are samples ("a human has two eyes" is metaphor: you don't mean a &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; human!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt; is a major source of metaphor in this regard. Time usually moves from back to front. &lt;em&gt;Movement&lt;/em&gt; is the key word: verbs of movements are extremely common expressors of time relations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The body is space&lt;/strong&gt;: using body parts to generate locatives is also a very common feature cross-linguistically, found in languages as distinct as Hebrew, Nahuatl and Swahili. The fact that virtually all languages in the world use body-relative directional (in front of, behind)... except for the aboriginal language Guugu Yimithirr, well known for using only absolute directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fabrication is causation&lt;/strong&gt;: the use of verbs meaning "make, create, fabricate" as causative auxiliary is a common metaphoric transfer of the idea of creating an object to "creating" an action in something else.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I tried to find conlangs based on such sounds but could not find any. However, the closest human phonemes to such sounds are clicks and many conlangs use them. I don't know any well-known conlangs that use clicks, but HyPry and Gdili were two that I could find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could try making one yourself, but given that Beatbox sounds are fairly limited and sometimes hard to distinguish, I doubt you would be able to make an effective language from it without adding in typical consonants and vowels. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A really simple but effective method to create an unintelligble language from a given language is applying a substitution cipher to the vocabulary. In order to be pronouncable, vowels should be substituted with vowels, and consonants with other consonant of comparable sonority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is of course a special case of a relexification, but is there a specific term for this?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A little background before my question: I am an amateur in mid-development of a logographic &lt;em&gt;writing system&lt;/em&gt;, not necessarily a whole language with phonetics. As I develop, I don't so much care about grammar, at least not yet. The language is heavily context-based, it requires you to have foreknowledge of the concepts it conveys, and ideas portrayed in the writing system are to be implied by the reader. It's memory-intensive, so you can't quite analyze it like, say, English, and determine its meaning through some roots or affixes.
In a nutshell, virtually no grammar. No specific way to order your ideas, just implied context.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas are distinguished by category: nouns, verbs, adjectives. (That should be used as a dominant identifier for the question yet to be asked)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that'll probably do it for background. My question is this: &lt;strong&gt;Is there an advantageous method to sort and organize characters of a logographic system, specifically for &lt;em&gt;dictionary look-up&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Given the properties I mentioned above.)&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current method is just sorting by the &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of ideas. Ex.: In the verb category, I may sort verbs whether they describe &lt;em&gt;positional&lt;/em&gt; things, e.g., &lt;em&gt;to be underneath&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;motional&lt;/em&gt; things, e.g., &lt;em&gt;to run&lt;/em&gt;, etc. For nouns, a similar system may be employed (haven't reached this point yet), as well as for adjectives.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I imagine that such an approach would/could create confusion. (Is an ice cream cake a cake or an ice cream? Why?)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, there must be other options I'm not seeing. &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/q/250"&gt;This question&lt;/a&gt;, for example, seems to brush the idea just a smidgen, but it is centered largely on computer programs for organization. &lt;strong&gt;For this&lt;/strong&gt;, I should specify that I am working entirely &lt;em&gt;on-paper&lt;/em&gt;. Computerization is not an option quite yet. I am strictly searching for methods for organizing a kind of lexicon, entries similar to those arrayed in an English dictionary.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Having a dictionary ordered by theme or idea is a good thing and it can carry you a long way in the design of your writing system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more systematic approach, you need a way to order your logograms. &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/How-does-alphabetical-order-or-sorting-order-work-in-Chinese" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chinese sorting&lt;/a&gt; may be an inspiration for you. They identify a "radical" in each character, and than order by radical + number and order of additional strokes. The approach has the advantage that simpler characters (with fewer strokes, and probably more frequent usage) come before more complex ones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;This is somewhat similar to "what's the purpose of odd and even numbers".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the sounds produced in human languages we can distinguish two different ways of articulation, one where sound waves are produced by the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis" rel="noreferrer"&gt;glottis&lt;/a&gt;, modulated in the vocal tract through opening of the jaw (open/closed) and position of the tongue (front/back), but otherwise pass through unrestricted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other type of sound does not depend on the glottis (whose action is optional), and an airflow is generated coming from the lungs, passing through the vocal tract; but this time, there are constrictions at various places of articulation, which modulate the frequency spectrum of the resulting sounds to produce significant differences. Depending on whether the glottis is active, these sounds can be classified as voiced or unvoiced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former are called vowels: they are always voiced, and are defined through the positions of jaw and tongue. The latter are consonants, and are defined through the place of the constriction (glottal, dental, labial, ...), the nature
of the constriction (fricatives, stops) and whether they are voiced or unvoiced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens, you kind of need both kinds of sounds in a language to make it pronounceable. Just like you need odd and even numbers to do maths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see this in syllables: a syllable has to have a vowel as its central element, and is surrounded by consonants. You can have different syllable structures: CV, VC, CVC, etc., and depending on language some structures are more common than others. But this is more of an emergent feature than some deliberate decision.&lt;/p&gt;

Depending on whether the glottis is active, these sounds can be classified as voiced or unvoiced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former are called vowels: they are always voiced, and are defined through the positions of jaw and tongue. The latter are consonants, and are defined through the place of the constriction (glottal, dental, labial, ...), the nature
of the constriction (fricatives, stops) and whether they are voiced or unvoiced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens, you kind of need both kinds of sounds in a language to make it pronounceable. Just like you need odd and even numbers to do maths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see this in syllables: a syllable has to have a vowel as its central element, and is surrounded by consonants. You can have different syllable structures: CV, VC, CVC, etc., and depending on language some structures are more common than others. But this is more of an emergent feature than some deliberate decision.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of vowels and consonants it to make up syllables. We just call the most prominent part of the syllable "vowel" and the the other sounds grouped around that core "consonants". Some sounds can be on both sides: There are languages where the liquids (l, m, n, r) can act as vowels, and some short vowels (i, u) can act as consonants usually named "glides" and given separate IPA symbols /j, w/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For spoken languages produced the usual way, having vowels and consonants is a natural thing. But there are even natural languages without vowels and consonants: The sign languages around the world don't have an equivalent to this distinction.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Sorry, my title is slightly misleading; what I'm after is more like a written language that doesn't have its roots in spoken language, and has no definitive translation into speech, but is none-the-less concise and clearly understandable. Tall order, I know - perhaps something similar would be cave-paintings: they seem to have a strong meaning that one could imagine was clear to people at the time, and which may convey a narrative of some sort; but the actual recital might have many variations. Or a more modern example: when you see a red circle around a drawing of a cigarette, with a red line across, you know it means that you are not allowed to smoke (so the meaning is clear and concise) - but the equivalent wording depends on the viewer, and could include phrases like "Don't smoke", "No smoking", or many others,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems achievable, at least, that one could construct such a language, which might even be universally understandable; but has it already been done in the form of a full language?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The answer is a definite &lt;em&gt;Yes, there are&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example that comes immediately to my mind is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blissymbols" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Bliss symbolics&lt;/a&gt; (also known as &lt;strong&gt;Semantography&lt;/strong&gt;) by Charles Bliss from 1942–1949. As an additional bonus, it is still used and developped further, and may even be included into Unicode at some date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: The term to look for is &lt;em&gt;pasigraphy&lt;/em&gt;. There were lots of pasigraphies (Blanke, Internationale Plansprachen, gives the number 60) mainly in the 19th century, but the most successful ones were created in the 20th century. There were both philosophical pasigraphies (often using digits or abstract symbols) and naturalistic ones (starting from pictograms).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The syntactical li structure was inspired by Toki Pisin ... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and in an online Tok Pisin grammar I found :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[...] Tok Pisin has its own grammatical rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, look at the following sentences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mi wok. 'I worked.'
Yu wok.  'You worked.'
Em i wok.  'He/she worked.'
Tom i wok.  'Tom worked.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the last two sentences have the little word i before the verb. (Remember that in Tok Pisin, i is pronounced something like "ee".) This little word is called a "predicate marker", and it must occur in a sentence when subject is em or a noun (like "Tom" or "the bicycle"). This rule is certainly different from anything found in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/satocenter/langnet/definitions/tokpisin.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.hawaii.edu/satocenter/langnet/definitions/tokpisin.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I presume that 'li' is also a "predicate marker" ...&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;ANADEW means "a natlang already did it even worse" or "a natlang already did it, except worse". In essence you thought of a strange feature for your conlang, but there is actually a natlang that has that (or a very similar) feature and did it worse than it is in your conlang.&lt;br&gt;
If, for example, Pythagoras had made a click conlang (which somehow survived one or two millenia) with simple and easy clicks, then the "discovery" of the Khoisan languages with very complex click systems (worse for Europeans) would have made an ANADEW case.&lt;br&gt;
I don't think that's the best possible example, you can find a few more at &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/6yxo6k/anadew_game/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/6yxo6k/anadew_game/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I have never heard of a "substitution cypher language."   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might adduce Pig Latin or Double Dutch as examples of such a thing, but these are not conlangs.   They are typically called "language games."  A substitution cypher is not a language--it's a way of disguising one or more languages.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To qualify as a conlang, a constructed communication system has to have its own grammar and its own way of mapping meanings onto words. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The language I am creating is derived from East Norse and heavily influenced by Slavic. It has a quite complex grammatical structure - for example, it has not only taken over the two additional cases from Russian but also developed several own ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One unique aspect is the dual noun form, which is avaliable for describing things that usually occur in complementary pairs. There are dual-only nouns for things that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; occur in the described pairs (such as a romantic couple) and dual forms of ordinary nouns in “natural” couple forms (a pair of shoes, the poles of a magnet, my eyes - not two houses or a couple of road signs). Some features are either identic to either singular and plural. A part of the pronouns - most notably all second-person pronouns - are however unique (somewhat similar to the dialect of Bavarian spoken in Munich).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am wondering how I can “trace back” such a development. According to my knowledge, (correct me if I am blatantly wrong) neither East Norse nor Old East Slavic had the aforementioned features, and just “inventing it by accident somewhere around 1100” would sound like a too handwaved explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Most of what are generally considered languages, whether natural or constructed, are in fact two languages, one written and one spoken. We usually learn the two together, and thus learn the mapping between them. These can vary in how obvious they are. At one extreme are languages that use a very standard mapping. It is virtually impossible to be able to read the Roman alphabet - in English or French, say, and to be able to speak Portuguese, but not to be able to read Portuguese, as a friend of mine found out. She had these skills but had never learnt to read Portuguese. Her mum was shocked to find her reading a book in Portuguese and asked where she learnt to do that. She had not learnt - she could just do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is English or Gaelic (and not many other languages) where the mapping is so poor that it is possible to be fluent in the spoken language, and not to be able to read the language, even though you can read another language in the same alphabet. 100 years ago there was a famous disaster involving a ship called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMY_Iolaire" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Iolaire&lt;/a&gt;. Virtually everyone on board, and the bereaved relatives, had Gaelic as a first language, but they could not read Gaelic and so had no idea the ship's name was Gaelic - they pronounced it as an English person would and had no idea what the name meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next come languages like Chinese, which is in fact several spoken languages, with one written language. The symbol 米 means rice. How you pronounce it varies according to whether you speak Mandarin or Cantonese, or even Japanese which sometimes uses Chinese symbols (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Kanji&lt;/a&gt;). Thus you can learn written Mandarin (you now know one word) with no clue as to how to pronounce it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use some logograms in English. Some, such as ☏, are pictographic in origin, and so have no inherent pronunciation - we just translate them to English as we read them. Others, such as &amp;, are alphabetic in origin. This one is a fancy way to write &lt;em&gt;et&lt;/em&gt;, which is Latin or French for "and". We ignore this and just pronounce it "and". Of course other people, such as the Germans, will pronounce these symbols differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could always learn a natural or constructed language from a book that had no pronunciation guide, if it was written in Cyrillic, using Chinese characters, or using its own made-up logograms. But of course, you could find out how to pronounce it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, a language could be constructed without a vocal form. I am not aware that this has occurred. The problem here is that there is no way stop someone inventing a vocal form for each symbol. This is a bit like learning Old English or Ancient Greek. We do not know exactly how they were pronounced, and so we use what is basically a modern guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only examples I can think of where there is no vocal form is the sign languages used by deaf communities. They are genuine languages, unlike signed English, and usually have no accepted spoken or written form.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Both the Brahmic scripts and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Aboriginal_syllabics" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Canadian Aboriginal syllabics&lt;/a&gt; have a grapheme for "suppress this sign's inherent vowel".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could get tedious with big clusters; also, if you're starting with a pure syllabary, you have to decide which vowel to suppress!&lt;/p&gt;

So you could just say that your conlang retained it the whole time. Alternatively you could say that it lost it and then subsequently borrowed it again from one of the Slavic languages which retained it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were after a specific source, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Church_Slavonic" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Old Church Slavonic&lt;/a&gt; could be ideal because it could have a wider influence than other Slavic languages through its religious prestige status. If the religious traditions of the Slavonic Orthodox churches were very highly valued by your conlang's speakers then that would help to explain why the dual number was retained by them even though the other languages of the region had lost it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I think taking the dual retained in old Indo-European languages is a good idea. However, if your language is settled in Skandinavia, you could attribute it to contact with an Uralic language.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the dual was lost in some (e.g. Finnish), dual pronouns are present in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_languages" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sami languages&lt;/a&gt; that go pretty far south and have been in that region for a long time. After that, extending the usage of the dual to nouns would be a far easier natural development.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, that contact could explain the cases your language developed, as Uralic languages all have complex case systems (depends on exactly which cases you have though).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I think we could use some terms from physics here. Let's say a relex is isochor (alternative: isomek from Ancient Greek mêkos "length") if it preserves length of words, and isotonic (alternative: isoson/isosonor/isosonic, a Latin-Greek mix) if it preserves sonority patterns. Your substitution cipher would then be an isochor-isotonic relexification.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Since most text is by its nature sequential, then if you start in tthe middle you will have to go in some direction from there, hence the various suggestions of spirals, top to bottom, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;boustrophedon&lt;/a&gt;, etc. But all of these methods have a direction, even if that direction changes as you go along. Even in normal writing you could start in the middle, just by leaving the first half of the first line blank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way I can see to avoid this directionality is to set off in two directions &lt;em&gt;at once&lt;/em&gt;. You could print something along with its mirror image, but in practice you would read one bit or the other. You could divide the information, for example by printing the vowels on the left, right to left, and the consonants on the right, left to right, but this would be hard to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is one other possibility which might count: how about a parallel text. You could print the Koran in Arabic on the left, with a line-by line translation in English on the right, or, similarly with the Hebrew Bible. I can't find any on the internet, but there must be one somewhere? Anyone interested in the traslation &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; would have to look at both sides to see how something was translated.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In my new language, I use tones, such as those in Mandarin and Cantonese, to diversify my words. When I try to make a dictionary, I do not know how to describe these tones. I have tried using parts different English words to describe what a tone sounds like, but that is not very efficient. Is there a simpler way to describe these tones?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;You can use standard musical notation to describe the tones of your conlang. Level tones are just represented by different notes, and tonal glides can be represented by groups of notes joined with a slur. The notes can also hint the duration of a syllable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative to that are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_letter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Tone Letters&lt;/a&gt; introduced by the Chinese linguist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chao_Yuen_Ren" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Yuen Ren Chao&lt;/a&gt; providing a nice visual cue to tone levels and contour tones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These means are for the explanation of the tones to the aspiring learner of your conlang, their representation in a writing system is another thing worth a separate question.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'd like to hear from anyone who has built a dialect continuum, in which innovations spreading from different centres affect overlapping subsets of the range (see &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_model" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;wave theory&lt;/a&gt;).  How do you model it?  How do you manage the results?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I'd start with a list of towns and a table determining how likely a town is to adopt an innovation from each of its neighbors.  The table can change over time as towns lose or gain influence, or new roads are made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then what? Maintain a separate grammar for each town?  Impractical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a list of sound shifts, you can easily generate a given town's version of a given lexeme as needed; but managing changes in syntax or morphology is, I'd think, not so easy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for parallels in animal communication, there's plenty of good evidence that environment shapes the kinds of sounds used. For instance, Henry &amp; Lucas (2010) showed that birds in forest habitats (more absorption) were more sensitive to frequency changes (FM), as modulated narrowband sounds (essentially, vowels) are more reliably transmitted in that cluttered environment. Birds living in open habitats had more temporal resolution, and tended to use more amplitude modulation. &lt;a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01674.x" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01674.x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I have never tried to do it, but I think the approach you call "impractical" is the way to go. You need to maintain a grammar and a vocabulary for each town and for each period (say, a snapshot every 50 or 100 years) to keep consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news that can save a lot of time is, that you probably don't need complete reference grammars for each step in the evolution: Start with a good grammar of the oldest stage of your language continuum and than write the grammars of the evolving dialects/languages in terms of differences to the old grammar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only when accumulated differences become too large to be handled well, write a full grammar again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;homonym&lt;/em&gt; is usually used for words that are spelt the same and pronounced the same, and i think this is what is intended here. Homographs are spelt the same but pronounced differently and homophones are pronounced the same but spelt differently. Both of these &lt;em&gt;shouldn't&lt;/em&gt; occur in Esperanto as there is an agreed pronunciation for each. However, to answer the question about homographs, which is clearly a part of the answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various homonyms have been suggested already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a feature of Esperanto, due to the origin of its lexis, that a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people know &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the words from their first language and there is always a temptation to pronounce these in the way more similar to that language. That means that wherever there are homonyms they may end up as homographs. To take &lt;em&gt;vato&lt;/em&gt; as an example, people may pronounce this as in their first language, even if they are meant to pronounce it the same as the word meaning "cotton wool*.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The question basically provides the answer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the primary writing (and reading) conditions the conscript was hypothetically developed and employed in. 
This obviously includes the affordances and constraints of medium and tool, but contents (accounting data, prose, correspondence, legal announcements, religious scripture etc.), environment (e.g. humidity, lighting, movement) and, of course, physiology of the writers and readers also play important roles. 
This will not be constant over times and places, too, so you get natural iterations and bifurcations that may later remerge 
(like how the printed bicameral roman script is a combination of uppercase letters made mostly for stone carving and lowercase letters evolved from pen/quill writing). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way you get the directions of writing pages, blocks, lines, words and characters. 
You get preferences for straight or curved, squared or circular, open or closed, flat or serifed, hanging or standing, leaning or upright, connected or separated, stacked or juxtaposed &amp;hellip; strokes and shapes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The frequency of use often determines the simplicity and distinctiveness of a glyph: the busiest ones tend to consist of the fewest basic shapes, often just a single one (like &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt;).
Naturally developing alphabetical letters (and digraphs) also have a tendency to &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; resemble the phonetic features of their corresponding sounds. 
This is true for roman lowercase letters for instance, though slightly different for other languages: while three bands (with ascender and descender) are available, vowels are restricted to the central band, sonorants are usually short as well, while fricatives and stops are longer (cf. sonority scale and length hierarchy of the syllable). 
Most orthographies avoid pairing big or complex characters, but often use a simple and a complex one (e.g. &lt;em&gt;ck&lt;/em&gt;); or they employ complex ligation with utterly different compound glyphs. 
Word or syllable starts and ends may be marked stronger (or weaker), e.g. descending &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; and wider &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; as allographic variants of &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;u&lt;/em&gt; at the end in English, which may also lead to canonically contextual, positional forms like roman long s or greek &amp;sigma; and a lot of letters in cursive arabic. 
That means the possible positions of a letter shape its glyph and the possible glyphs of a letter influence its adoption for certain positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the goal should not be to invent something distinctively new but to design something plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The frequency of use often determines the simplicity and distinctiveness of a glyph: the busiest ones tend to consist of the fewest basic shapes, often just a single one (like &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt;).
Naturally developing alphabetical letters (and digraphs) also have a tendency to &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; resemble the phonetic features of their corresponding sounds. 
This is true for roman lowercase letters for instance, though slightly different for other languages: while three bands (with ascender and descender) are available, vowels are restricted to the central band, sonorants are usually short as well, while fricatives and stops are longer (cf. sonority scale and length hierarchy of the syllable). 
Most orthographies avoid pairing big or complex characters, but often use a simple and a complex one (e.g. &lt;em&gt;ck&lt;/em&gt;); or they employ complex ligation with utterly different compound glyphs. 
Word or syllable starts and ends may be marked stronger (or weaker), e.g. descending &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; and wider &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; as allographic variants of &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;u&lt;/em&gt; at the end in English, which may also lead to canonically contextual, positional forms like roman long s or greek &amp;sigma; and a lot of letters in cursive arabic. 
That means the possible positions of a letter shape its glyph and the possible glyphs of a letter influence its adoption for certain positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the goal should not be to invent something distinctively new but to design something plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Here is the scenario:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In or before the Classical Period, a king from some Greek city-state--it doesn't matter which--first brought all the other Greek city-states together to become one unified nation.  Either he or his heir then declared that the whole of the Mediterranean belong to the Greeks.  First phase of the grand plan was to conquer the Mediterranean was to absorb the lands of their closest neighbors, the Roman Republic.  The Republic, weak from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_the_Orders" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the Conflict of the Orders&lt;/a&gt;, embraced their Greek conquerors with minimal resistance.  In absorbing Greek and Roman lands together, Greek and Roman culture merged into one, and that includes language.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspiration behind this scenario is that both Greek and Roman cultures have such inspirations on modern Western culture that it's hard to decipher where Greek ended and Roman began.  But what if both cultures were merged into one new one?  If you mix Greek with Latin, what should I look out for in regards to grammar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I ask this because many people are not convinced that Glosa, an auxlang already inspired by both Greek and Latin, won't be the natural answer to this question.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The situation you describe, in which Classical Greece invades the Roman Republic, has two probable outcomes. (This is assuming a single language "merged into one" excludes the possibility of both languages coexisting. However, a language can also exert influence on another without supplanting it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Romans adopted (or were forced to adopt) their conquerors' language, which is what happened in other nations after Alexander the Great's conquests later in history, then the spoken language would become Greek. The influence of the Latin language in such a case would exist as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_(linguistics)#Substratum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;substrate&lt;/a&gt;, which could introduce Latin loan words and grammatical structures into Roman Greek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Romans didn't choose (or weren't forced) to adopt Greek as their language and continued to speak Latin, then Latin would remain the spoken language, but would have Greek influence on vocabulary and grammar, as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_(linguistics)#Superstratum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;superstrate or adstrate&lt;/a&gt;. As it is, Latin already has Greek influence on its vocabulary, with learned words like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/philosophia#Latin" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;philosophia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;; but in the case of a Greek conquest, it would probably gain more mundane words as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comparable case in history with regard to English could be the Norman invasion of England. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Norman_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Anglo-Norman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; were spoken alongside each other. Eventually, English was the only language spoken of the two in England, but not without &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_French_origin" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;considerable influence&lt;/a&gt; from Anglo-Norman. Looking at this case might give an idea of how a language could change followed by the invasion of another one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Yes, having a separate grammar for each town would be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When modelling the spread of linguistic difference, do bear in mind geography, rather than just distance. Some regions can be very close in mountainous terrain but still have very different languages/dialects, whereas regions in flat plains (without major rivers) tend to be far more similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a map with geographical features, use something like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;A*&lt;/a&gt; to calculate the distance between towns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regarding changes in grammar: if your grammar is expressed in the form of rewrite rules, you could allow them to change as well. A fairly radical change would be from&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NP -&gt; adj n
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NP -&gt; n adj
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ie the adjective moves behind the noun it modifies. The resulting grammar would of course still be valid. However, you want to make such changes very rare and slow. Alternatively, annotate each rule with a probability, and then have both rules in parallel. Change would then be an increase/decrease in probability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For language change in general you might be interested in &lt;a href="http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Piotrowski-Gesetz" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Piotrowski's Law&lt;/a&gt;. (Unfortunately the only explanation I have found for it is in German). This models mathematically how change spreads throughout language.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs could be written in any direction (LTR, RTL, TTB, BTT). On ornamental pieces and buildings, writing was frequently started at the center (e.g. the central temple gate) working outward in both directions. The best readable example I can show you is a replica of this writing style mimicked on the Memphis Zoo entrance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WNHB2.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WNHB2.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can derive the reading direction by checking in which directions the human and animal glyphs are looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the hierglyphs are modern inventions for animals unknown to Ancient Egypt, but most of it checks out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I think vowel + shift in tone is key. If you'd just have different tones (as in notes) for vowels, that would conflict with expressions of pain, surprise, etc. In Asian Philology, when we talk about "tones", we actually mean a change in pitch for a vowel. Chinese has 4: Same, Up, Down and Down+Up. Thai for example has more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a grid of the most used tonal notation systems for Chinese:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common in use today is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pinyin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;For readers who aren't familiar with the Theory of Relativity, here is a sketch of how the Special Theory of Relativity structures space and time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a point "here and now" where the observer is located&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an "absolute past" meaning the region of space and time wherefrom light signals can reach the point "here and now". This region is also termed &lt;em&gt;backward light-cone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an "absolute future" meaning the region of space and time whereto the observer can send light signals. This region is also called &lt;em&gt;foreward light-cone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a "disconnected" region that can neither be reached by light signals nor send light signals to the observer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While present, past, and future are commonly found in natlangs and conlangs of all flavours, the disconnected region is a new feature brought in by the Special Theory of Relativity. Are there conlangs with a tempus system including such a region?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: In real life, the disconnected region is not determined by the speed of light but by the availability of direct communication channels. Thus a sentence like &lt;em&gt;My husband is in his working office now&lt;/em&gt; is about the disconnected region (assume no smart phone stalking to verify the sentence).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Time travel is a standard trope in Science Fiction and Fantasy. Since time travel disrupts the normal perception of time time travellers may develop some linguistic means to deal with this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is: What are examples of either constructed languages for time travellers or constructed varieties of natural languages used by time travellers and how do they deal with aspects related to time travel?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In order to construct a realistic and suitable writing system, these are some things you should consider before you think about how you want it to look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could your needs be served by a writing system in existence realistically? For example, if you're creating a Slavic language, you could easily use the Cyrillic or Latin scripts (cf. Russian, Czech); there's no need to design a new script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do geographically or lexically similar languages use as their primary scripts? Finnish uses the Latin script as a result of Swedish influence, even though Swedish is not related to Finnish linguistically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the language intersect with the culture of the people speaking it? Although Serbian and Croatian are technically the same language, they typically use different writing systems because Serbians tend to be Orthodox (Cyrillic-associated) and Croatians tend to be Catholic (Latin-associated). Conversely, Cantonese uses the same script as Mandarin despite not being the same language due to geographical and political similarities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When did your language and its script split off from its ancestors, and how were they written? Despite Greek not being a Semitic language, it had a close proximity to the Phoenicians and thus borrowed their alphabet. But if your language came more recently, perhaps you should base it upon a more recent alphabet such as Greek itself, or even the Latin script (as with Lisu).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How strict is your language phonologically, and what semantic effect does changing vowels or consonants have? Arabic uses an abjad in part because the consonants provide the actual base meaning, while vowels change various minutiae, while Japanese (in part) can use a syllabary because it's very restrictive with syllable structure. On the other hand, Georgian uses a full alphabet because it has so many consonant clusters, which can't really be expressed concisely in a syllabary or abugida.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt; you can consider how you want it to look. You can give something a more cursive or angular appearance while still basing it off of something relevant. This also gives it more of a unique flavor even if you're using an existing system. This is something you could do for a Phoenician-based system that doesn't look like Phoenician (crude, but you get the point):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HtpJI.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HtpJI.png" alt="Phoenician aleph; on the right is a symbol that looks like a reversed Latin thorn."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should additionally think about the direction in which your script is supposed to be written - letter forms can change based on that. They tend to lean right in an LTR script and vice versa, and be either thin and tall or confined to a square for a vertical script (like traditional Mongolian/Uyghur and Chinese hànzì respectively). Also, vertical scripts don't often have completely open bottoms or tops of characters like LTR scripts might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a fantasy world, where you're relying less on historicity and looking more for inspiration, you kind of just need to look at different scripts applying the sort of aesthetic you want, then alter them and perhaps combine them together into a whole system. If you enjoy neat and somewhat simplistic scripts with varying letter heights, you could combine inspiration from Latin and Armenian. For loopy, natural-looking scripts, take a look at Georgian and Greek. There are tons of different writing systems across the world, and I guarantee you'll find inspiration somewhere if you &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_writing_systems" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;look&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Like Classical Latin, which was probably never spoken in daily life &lt;em&gt;(in contrast with Vulgar Latin)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or just simply a language that is based off an actual natural language, but highly stylized and artificial, having had diglosia with its parent-language since the start, never having been an actual spoken language at any point in history.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;You're describing a couple different and not totally related things with different terminology used for each: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classical Latin is an example of a literary language, a language used not really in speech but used to communicate through writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern Standard Arabic, one of those artificial languages based off of a natural one but not really being a spoken language. It's very frequently affected by diglossia, and not really used in natural settings. It's usually referred to as simply a standardized lanuage, and also qualifies as a literary language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hebrew as spoken in daily life in Israel would qualify as the first type you described, a modernized version of an old language that was resurrected after death. It would be referred to as a revived language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;That's a tough one. All languages (previously) in existence are in essence linear, because they are phonetic representations of human experience. Even when describing the past or the future, language does so in a linear form. Also, any human language is itself subject to time, with one phoneme uttered after another. In addition, the grammars of some languages are very restrictive to allow expression of effect preceding cause, etc. For example, Indo-Germanic languages cannot have verbs without a subject and the subject must precede the verb. So looking at natural languages it is clear that some are better suited to express time paradoxes etc. than others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the best candidate languages to extend or base a &lt;em&gt;conlang&lt;/em&gt; on would be those languages that do not change sentence structure for singular vs plural, present vs past or future, affirmative vs negative, certain vs conditional, etc. Japanese for example would be a good candidate. To change all of the aforementioned sentence parameters you would just use suffixes, e.g. &lt;em&gt;-ta&lt;/em&gt; for past tense, &lt;em&gt;-tachi&lt;/em&gt; for plural, &lt;em&gt;-yo&lt;/em&gt; for conditional, etc. It could therefore easily be extended with suffixes to express time paradoxes, timelines, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another language that meets the conditions of unchanging sentence structure related to time &amp; conditions would be Chinese (Literary Chinese to be exact, Modern Chinese would be a bit more problematic due to its compound phrases). This is a monosyllabic language where word meaning is based on tone. Chinese currently has 4 tones. You could add modulations to these tones to express time travel related conditions and effects. But unless you've been brought up in this language it would be extremely hard to learn (just learning to distinguish the current 4 tones in all circumstances is already a daunting task for a non-native speaker unless you're also musically inclined).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to construct a &lt;em&gt;conlang&lt;/em&gt; that is not based on any existing language, a good candidate would be a language that is based on harmonics (i.e. multiple frequencies uttered at the same time). Different harmonics could represent different time-related states. However, human vocal chords are not really up to the task of uttering complex harmonics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's probably many other ways to answer your question but here's my 2 cents :)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;No, a conlang does not &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; any of it. You can construct a language based on gestures (a sign language) or on whistles, or on other signals transporting information. You can construct a &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/781/are-there-any-unspeakable-languages"&gt;Pasigraphy&lt;/a&gt;, i.e., a written-only language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for a more conventional design that meets our intuition of language, you will probably use sounds and words, and letters to write the language. It is up to your creativity to come up with original sounds and letters, but there is definetely no need to do so. Many conlang designs rely on sounds (and complete phonologies) that occur in natural languages, and use usual letters (mostly Latin, but also Cyrillic or other existing writing systems like Runes) for writing. The words of a conlang are most often original but I even can imagine a conlang without original words: Draw existing words for natural languages in an eclectic way or create a conlang closely based on a natural language or a group of natural languages. The vocabulary of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua" rel="noreferrer"&gt;IALA Interlingua&lt;/a&gt; is hardly original.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As has already been said, the answer is, generally &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;. However, I’d like to look into it a bit deeper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many (most?) constructed languages are written with the Latin script, i.e. what I’m using right now to write this answer. However, many conlangers find the base set of 26 characters it provides too restrictive, and will make use of things like diacritics (áèñħ…), special characters used in some languages or the IPA (ŋß…) or letters from other alphabets (εφϑ…). This is a choice, and by no means a necessity. Some conlangers, in particular those creating languages for a constructed world, also like to invent entire writing systems and consider the representation with the Latin script (“romanisation”) merely a tool for easy representation online. Again, this is optional, but depending on your goals might be a good idea. It would not make sense to create a new writing system for an auxiliary language though, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s three ways one might interpret this question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I have to make my words sound different (from English / any other language)? Certainly not: auxiliary languages often take heavy inspiration from existing languages, as familiarity makes it easier to learn a language. Similarly, if you want to toy around with grammar but don’t really care about the actual outcome, you might as well just use placeholder words taken straight from English and focus on what you really care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I have to make words which mean different things than the words in English/any other language? Here I am inclined to say &lt;strong&gt;yes&lt;/strong&gt;. If you simply copy an English dictionary and replace all the words by other sounding words, then you’ve created what is called a &lt;em&gt;relex&lt;/em&gt;. Whether relexes are considered conlangs or not is up for debate, in my eyes they are ciphers. However, there’s layers upon layers to this - is a conlang still a relex if you copy the lexicon but use completely different grammar? Perhaps not, but it’s not as interesting as if you also made a custom lexicon. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that doing so takes away most of what makes a conlang unique. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I have to follow the idea of having sentences broken down into words? Absolutely not: it’s actually surprisingly hard (read: an unsolved problem) to define the concept of a word in a way that works for every language. Look into the (just as loosely defined) concept of polysynthesis if you’re intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language doesn’t have to rely on sound. There’s sign languages as a primary counterexample that also shows up “in real life”, and on top of that, graphical (written only), touch based and many other kinds of languages have been created. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s assume you’re going to be making a spoken language. Two questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I have to make &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; sounds? Well… no. There’s only so many sounds our mouths can make and most of them already occur in some language (and those that don’t, e.g. smacking ones teeth together don’t occur for good reasons), so it’s rather hard to even &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; new sounds. But if you’re making a language meant for aliens/sapient animals/whatever nonhuman you can come up with, then maybe you might want to. But many conlangers don’t bother, as it is &lt;em&gt;really hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I have to make a new sound system or can I just use the sounds of English/other language? Same point as with the words above: You don’t have to, and if your goal is to focus on other parts of the conlang you might as well ignore it, but if your goal is to make a good, interesting and unique conlang, then… yea you should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, what you do and don’t do depends entirely on your design goals. If you wanna toy with a particular grammar concept, then focus on the essentials. If you wanna make the new big international auxlang then keep things familiar to the target audience. If you want to make a natural looking conlang, then go all in and be creative.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The selection of words in Esperanto tried to prevent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;homonyms&lt;/strong&gt;, same sounding words: &lt;code&gt;trajn/o&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;em&gt;train&lt;/em&gt;, railroad, &lt;code&gt;trejn/ist/o&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;em&gt;trainer&lt;/em&gt;; but also &lt;code&gt;poliso&lt;/code&gt; = (insurance) &lt;em&gt;policy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;code&gt;politiko&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;em&gt;policy&lt;/em&gt;, measure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;word parts&lt;/strong&gt; that could be mistaken as infixes; partly with artificial changes (&lt;code&gt;kun&lt;/code&gt; - instead of &lt;code&gt;kon*&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;em&gt;with / in company,&lt;/em&gt; as many latin derived words start with &lt;code&gt;kon&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;kongreso&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;kontraŭ&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;synonyms&lt;/strong&gt;, picking different words, if a word holds different meanings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;false friends&lt;/strong&gt; in other languages (&lt;code&gt;tago&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;em&gt;day&lt;/em&gt; - instead of &lt;code&gt;deo*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dio&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;em&gt;god&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bona&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes Esperanto a more disambiguating language in some respects. It is not one hundred percent perfect, &lt;code&gt;ŭato&lt;/code&gt; (= &lt;em&gt;Watt&lt;/em&gt;) was (unsuccessfully) proposed to disambiguate from &lt;code&gt;vato&lt;/code&gt; (= &lt;em&gt;cotton wool&lt;/em&gt;). Or &lt;code&gt;plumo&lt;/code&gt; = (1) &lt;em&gt;pen&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;code&gt;skribilo&lt;/code&gt;), (2) &lt;em&gt;feather&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homography&lt;/strong&gt; should not happen in Esperanto: different pronunciations for the same spelling. However related are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rare letter/sound &lt;code&gt;ĥ&lt;/code&gt; that often was reformed to &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;ĥemio&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;kemio&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;em&gt;chemistry&lt;/em&gt;; both forms valid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The suffix &lt;code&gt;-uj&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;franco&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;em&gt;Frenchman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Francujo&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;Francio&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;em&gt;France&lt;/em&gt;. This suffix was alienated as &lt;code&gt;-ij*&lt;/code&gt; would be a phonetically too ambiguous combination for usage in Esperanto. However later in history an &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; reform introduced a more "international" form, with its own problems.&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt; -- after a fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main issue I have with your question lies in the specific terms used: words, letters &amp; sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the answers have gotten around these things by pointing out whistle or sign languages. And I agree: technically speaking, in a sign language, there are no words and certainly no sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason the answer is actually yes, I contend, is because I am sure what you actually mean by "words" is "discrete meaning carrying units of language" and by "sounds" &amp; "letters" you probably mean "some way to convey said meaning through an interpersonal medium of communication".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When taken at the broader level, of course, language has to have "meaning carrying units" and it has to have "medium of communication". Else, language ceases to have meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that yes, ever invented language must have "words" (whether those words are spoken, signed, thought or written) as tokens of meaningful communication; and they must have "sounds" (whether spoken by mouth through the air or sent via radio waves between antennae) as a native &amp; non-technological way of conveying meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Letters" indicate a specifically technological advancement to communication via language. An invented language's culture does not need to be that advanced. And even if it were, it would not need "its own" letters. It could borrow either someone else's writing system; for example the way Persian borrowed Arabic writing. Even though Persians had been writing for centuries already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that yes, ever invented language must have "words" (whether those words are spoken, signed, thought or written) as tokens of meaningful communication; and they must have "sounds" (whether spoken by mouth through the air or sent via radio waves between antennae) as a native &amp; non-technological way of conveying meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Letters" indicate a specifically technological advancement to communication via language. An invented language's culture does not need to be that advanced. And even if it were, it would not need "its own" letters. It could borrow either someone else's writing system; for example the way Persian borrowed Arabic writing. Even though Persians had been writing for centuries already.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interlingue&amp;oldid=882195094" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia article on Occidental/Interlingue&lt;/a&gt; says (in this version):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to the Occidental magazine Cosmoglotta in 1928, a majority of Ido adherents took up Occidental in place of Ido.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, &lt;em&gt;Cosmosglotta&lt;/em&gt; isn't an unbiased publication venue. Is there any independent evidence that this switching of language actually took place?&lt;/p&gt;

While comparing reddit subscribers may not be the most scientific method, it's probably fair to assume this reflects their popularity in general. It's impossible to really know if most Ido-ists switched to Occidental back in the 1920s, but even if they did I think it's fair to say that later generations preferred Ido to Interlingue. Perhaps confusion with the more popular &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Interlingua&lt;/a&gt; is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;While Glosa definitely does seem to take a lot of influence from English, it's grammar isn't quite so indistinguishable from English's as to be an &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; relex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It avoids classic relex mistakes like including do-support, and while its tense-aspect system doesn't do anything too wild for English speakers, it uses a variety of particles rather than English's auxiliary-based periphrastic tenses. It's also noteworthy that it lacks plurals, a decidedly un-English-like feature. Both these features were likely inspired by Mandarin Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glosa also has an article that is unspecified for definiteness, using &lt;em&gt;u(n)&lt;/em&gt; for both "the" and "a(n)", which is a departure from its major influences -- English, which has distinct definite and indefinite articles; Mandarin Chinese, which doesn't have any such articles; and Esperanto, which possesses one explicitly definite article. However, this article's syntactic behavior does not seem notably different from the English or Esperanto articles, so it's not thinking too far outside the box there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could definitely argue that Glosa's departures from English are pretty small, and that it's thus still quite relex-y in spirit. It's certainly closer to normal English grammatically than Interglossa, which is reportedly based on Simple English. So it really depends exactly how far you think a conlang must depart from English grammatically to "count" as not being a relex.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Subjective idealism is the monistic metaphysical doctrine that only minds and mental contents exist. It entails and is generally identified or associated with immaterialism, the doctrine that material things do not exist. Subjective idealism rejects dualism, neutral monism, and materialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could my to be constructed language be restricted to such view of reality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess is that its semantic primes should consist of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;qualia: individual instances of subjective, conscious experience such as  the redness of an evening sky, pain of a headache, the taste of wine, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pronoun like *I* to refer to one's self&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verbs such as *think*, *believe*, *know*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adverbs such as: *now*, *before*, *after*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objects (e.g. &lt;em&gt;chair&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;table&lt;/em&gt;, etc.), other personal pronouns (&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt;, etc.), matter and all the other things that do not really exist (in the view of subjective idealism) would be defined as paraphrases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Note that this is not a question on subjective idealism in reality, but about subjective idealism in a constructed world. Therefore arguments against subjective idealism in reality are irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revised answer:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a maxim of geopoesy: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;who makes the world makes the rules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a secondary world, a world of your own devising, an invented language would not need to "enforce" subjective idealism at all.  Only one thing is required, and that is to "set the dial" of your subcreation to subjective idealism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; world, only the mind and mental constructs have true existence. The language a mind devises for itself to communicate (within itself) and assuming the mind that exists is a human mind, will arise to describe its experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think your semantic primes would probably be sufficient to describe both the &lt;em&gt;realia&lt;/em&gt; of the mind-being's existence: the 1s pronoun, the concrete verbs such as "think", "know" and "believe", the qualia of phantasms created within the mind. Because sunsets and wine do not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the world you subcreate is, in actuality, a typological copy of the primary world, where things outside the mind have actual existence, then you run into the exact same issues I dealt with when your question was about the primary world itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a language, I hold, would not be able to "enforce" subjective idealism in any meaningful way. It would not be able to overcome the steak and eggs problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original response to unedited query (regarding subjective idealism within the primary world) retained for historical purposes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subjective idealism is the monistic metaphysical doctrine that only minds and mental contents exist. It entails and is generally identified or associated with immaterialism, the doctrine that material things do not exist. Subjective idealism rejects dualism, neutral monism, and materialism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How could my to be constructed language be restricted to such view of reality?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very interesting thought experiment! But I believe is simply not practicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think a language of any kind will be able to enforce that kind of (quite silly) perspective of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to pull it off, I think you would have to first, absolutely and positively convince yourself that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_idealism" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; was a) on to something and b) that a) is The Something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, reason and common sense inform us that things do actually exist. Things outside the mind, things outside of mental construct. I can sit my weary bones down on a chair and be thankful that chairs exist. They're not mental constructs.  They're articles of furniture made of wood and designed and built to be sat in. That's reason and common sense refuting Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I had a look at Mr Berkeley's picture in that article. He looks pretty well fed to me.  Not emaciated, not dehydrated. I'll just bet he enjoyed a good steak and eggs for breakfast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true subjective idealist would also have to be a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inedia" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;practical breatharian&lt;/a&gt;, because food does not exist. It's an insubstantial construct of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your language to really function, you too would have to become a breatharian. You know: immerse yourself in the culture! Let us know how far you get in the practical application of this kind of philosophical language!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific to your last point re objects: I think, since objects do not exist and are therefore irrelevant to the thought and being of the mind, you could probably get away with a language where all substantives (apart from the 1s) are reduced to a single pronominal stem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trees don't exist, so you wouldn't really need a word for "tree". I don't exist, so you don't need a word for "elemtilas". This post doesn't exist, so you don't need words for "stack exchange" or "invented language" or "post" or "forum".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a maxim of geopoesy: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;who makes the world makes the rules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a secondary world, a world of your own devising, an invented language would not need to "enforce" subjective idealism at all.  Only one thing is required, and that is to "set the dial" of your subcreation to subjective idealism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; world, only the mind and mental constructs have true existence. The language a mind devises for itself to communicate (within itself) and assuming the mind that exists is a human mind, will arise to describe its experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think your semantic primes would probably be sufficient to describe both the &lt;em&gt;realia&lt;/em&gt; of the mind-being's existence: the 1s pronoun, the concrete verbs such as "think", "know" and "believe", the qualia of phantasms created within the mind. Because sunsets and wine do not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the world you subcreate is, in actuality, a typological copy of the primary world, where things outside the mind have actual existence, then you run into the exact same issues I dealt with when your question was about the primary world itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a language, I hold, would not be able to "enforce" subjective idealism in any meaningful way. It would not be able to overcome the steak and eggs problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original response to unedited query (regarding subjective idealism within the primary world) retained for historical purposes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subjective idealism is the monistic metaphysical doctrine that only minds and mental contents exist. It entails and is generally identified or associated with immaterialism, the doctrine that material things do not exist. Subjective idealism rejects dualism, neutral monism, and materialism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How could my to be constructed language be restricted to such view of reality?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very interesting thought experiment! But I believe is simply not practicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think a language of any kind will be able to enforce that kind of (quite silly) perspective of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to pull it off, I think you would have to first, absolutely and positively convince yourself that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_idealism" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; was a) on to something and b) that a) is The Something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, reason and common sense inform us that things do actually exist. Things outside the mind, things outside of mental construct. I can sit my weary bones down on a chair and be thankful that chairs exist. They're not mental constructs.  They're articles of furniture made of wood and designed and built to be sat in. That's reason and common sense refuting Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I had a look at Mr Berkeley's picture in that article. He looks pretty well fed to me.  Not emaciated, not dehydrated. I'll just bet he enjoyed a good steak and eggs for breakfast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true subjective idealist would also have to be a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inedia" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;practical breatharian&lt;/a&gt;, because food does not exist. It's an insubstantial construct of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your language to really function, you too would have to become a breatharian. You know: immerse yourself in the culture! Let us know how far you get in the practical application of this kind of philosophical language!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific to your last point re objects: I think, since objects do not exist and are therefore irrelevant to the thought and being of the mind, you could probably get away with a language where all substantives (apart from the 1s) are reduced to a single pronominal stem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trees don't exist, so you wouldn't really need a word for "tree". I don't exist, so you don't need a word for "elemtilas". This post doesn't exist, so you don't need words for "stack exchange" or "invented language" or "post" or "forum".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I assume that the inhabitants of your constructed world are humans (or at least have comparable minds to humans).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The is a famous hypothesis in lingusitics, called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Linguisitc Relativity or Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; that claims (to different degrees) that the language shapes the mind and the world view. Experimental studies only show weak effects, if any. We can assume that humans are able to develop every thought in any language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, authors have used this to some effect in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity#Artificial_languages" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;fiction writing&lt;/a&gt;—in a constructed fictional world you have the licence to do so and to ignore hard science.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The real answer is that &lt;strong&gt;languages don't actually have free word order&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather, languages with 'free' word order use the rearrangements to signify additional meaning. Here, look at English:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey, what did you eat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a plain question, indicated by shifting the 'what' from its underlying position to the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wait, you ate what?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of a logician, this sentence should mean the same thing, right? But it doesn't. When you don't shift a wh-word, it doesn't remain a question, it's a statement of surprise and maybe a request for clarification. It's also stylistically informal, and wouldn't be used in a sentence. In other words, it's what linguists call a 'pragmatic shift'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every&lt;/em&gt; language with 'free' word order does something like this. Traditional grammar and logic tends to downplay or be unaware of word order and pragmatics, and so people who speak such languages tend to believe that words can be arranged in any which way you want. But underlyingly, every arrangement of word order carries a stylistic or pragmatic significance, and using the 'wrong' arrangement will make it sound off to a fluent speaker, even if they couldn't explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esperanto is an interesting example -- officially speaking, Esperanto has totally free word order. But in practice, Esperanto word orderings follow unspoken stylistic and pragmatic rules (typically lifted from Germanic and Slavic). So this would presumably occur with any fluently spoken language, conlang or not.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia says that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Basic English&lt;/a&gt; is an English-based controlled language, an international auxiliary language, and an aid for teaching English as a second language. Basic English is, in essence, a simplified subset of regular English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is: there is a fixed number of 850 basic words for beginners, but there is no definite list. Some lists have 1500 words, others have 2000 words, but one can always draw more words from the English language. For instance: how would you talk about a cucumber, an oak tree or a rhinoceros without some silly circumlocution or using the real English word? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;is Basic English a well-defined constructed language that can exists on its own?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The website describing Ogden's Basic English is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
Wiktionary has the 850 word list &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Basic_English_word_list" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue that Basic English is a (rather) well defined invented language.  Wikipedia lists it as a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_natural_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;controlled natural language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which simply means that it is a natural language whose natural form and evolution have been suspended and its new form and evolution have been created by someone. In this case, Charles Ogden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classical Latin I have seen argued is a similar beast: a natural language that has some constructed or artificial tendencies, just not a single author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controlled language is, I would argue, the "fourth axial point of the &lt;a href="http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Glosso/Glossopoeia.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gnoli Triangle&lt;/a&gt;" --- the point where the art, science/engineering &amp; practicality of invented languages become cotangent with the world of natural languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic English and its relatives might thus be seen as "conlang-natlang creoles". Where the creolisation process happens between two types of language rather than between two specific languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for existing on its own, I think that is a rather different matter. If we were to replace the grammar with some kind of &lt;em&gt;fundamental&lt;/em&gt; rule list and replace the English lexicon with unique, perhaps even levelled-Germanic words, we'd basically end up reinventing Esperanto.  Or Folksprak.  As such, yes, it could "exist on its own".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Basic English is quite different among auxlangs, in that its essential function is that of a "bridge language".  It is designed to bring people who have no English at all across the gap and to a place where they can immerse themselves in the broader Anglophone world. Basic English is thus, in this key regard, self limiting in scope and usefulness.  It's great so long as the learner has extremely limited access to English speakers or English media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as that learner discovers the Internet or Anglophone aural culture (radio, television, movies) or English literature (broadly defined as anything written), they are going to discover the limitations imposed by Basic English. They'll have to leave it behind. In that sense, Basic English can't really have its own existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build on your example: a Basic English speaker would simply have to step off the bridge and begin learning the "extended" lexicon of ordinary English!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Many languages, like Japanese and Korean, have particles added to words to show which part of speech they are. While word order is still necessary for these languages to make sense, a conlang might have grammar where each word's part of speech is not defined by their place in the sentence, but what particles are attached to the words. A similar effect could be achieved by using different pitches or different word forms to define a word's part of speech. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Ted Chang wrote "Story of Your Life" which was the basis for the movie Arrival. I thought both the book and the visual representation in the film were excellent examples of languages based on a travelers use of time. In this story understanding the language is to understand your life as a simultaneous event, and thus have access to all moments at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also want to consider Jargon specific to your vision of time travel. Do paradox occur, and if so what is the resultant outcome? Do parallel realities exist, are there different types? Can futures be erased or overwritten, if so, what do you call a future that no longer exists, or a person lost in one? Do you have some sort of McGuffin for the travelling part? Is the language the means of travel? Do bodies travel or only minds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might consider leveraging something like Hobo signs, notes left by other travelers, with help or warnings, that type of thing. Alternatively, Signals of fealty and place, such as a question and response or sing the local anthem to identify other travelers as friend or foe. Flushing out what you want them to communicate, as well as the mood or archetypes of the speakers, might help drive the sound and appearance of the language.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Basically, your question is misstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our own world, languages cannot enforce philosophies. You can be a Hegelian, a Tomist, a Berkelian, or a Marxist, in any given language, from Modern English to Ancient Farsi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, all languages have this pesky word, "no", so that anything that can be affirmed can also be negated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a constructed world, everything is possible - negation of entropy, FTL travel, and all kinds of magic. So in your constructed world, language makes impossible for people to follow any other philosophy than subjective idealism. &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; language does this? It is better not to explain it, or only do it through applied phlebotinum - like SF writers do when describing FTL travel or the nature of &lt;em&gt;mana&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest this fiction, &lt;a href="http://art.yale.edu/file_columns/0000/0066/borges.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&lt;/a&gt; by Jorge Luís Borges; it might be somewhat similar to - though somewhat more disquieting than - what you intend.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Look into the way Sanskrit works, and the words they use when discussing Hindu doctrines. I read somewhere that the Sanskrit word for meat, "Mamsa", is a word containing the words for "Me" and "You", referencing that as you kill and eat an animal, you will become an animal in a future lifetime that who you killed will hunt and eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theological/metaphysical statement is right there in a common statement - So the implications of subjective idealism would have to be used to describe phenomena from the most accurate perspective of the worldview.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Most auxiliary languages I know of, especially Esperanto, are primarily &lt;em&gt;a posteriori&lt;/em&gt;—that is, their vocabulary or grammar are derived from other existing languages, and most are fairly Eurocentric. While many might have &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; grammar, but not vocabulary, I have yet to see another language that is entirely &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;—not derived from other languages. Do any such languages exist? Note I am talking about languages designed to be an international auxiliary language.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Short answer: &lt;strong&gt;I've never seen or read a description of what you're seeking&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long answer: &lt;strong&gt;What you're seeking is a most unlikely beast, reason being&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, &lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/International_auxiliary_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;auxiliary languages&lt;/a&gt; seek being completely or nearly completely &lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/A_posteriori_conlang" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a posteriori&lt;/a&gt; for reasons of simple expedience. Common design goals of an auxiliary language are &lt;em&gt;ease of learning&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;simplicity of use&lt;/em&gt;.  These goals are best met when vocabulary and grammar are familiar to the target audience.  This is why &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Interlingua&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt; are considered "easy" languages to learn and have gained considerable user communities, with Esperanto boasting a small community of native level speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you're describing, a completely &lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/A_priori_conlang" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a priori&lt;/a&gt; invented language is most usually the domain of the &lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/Artlang" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;artistic language&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/Engineered_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;engineered language&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.frathwiki.com/Philosophical_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;philosophical language&lt;/a&gt;. With the exception of the philosophical inventors, most glossopoets are not interested in propagandising their languages as auxiliary languages.  Occasionally a philosophical language inventor will propose his language as a means of general communication, but this is usually done from a position of ignorance as to how language works (accomplished auxiliary language proponents are usually quite well aware how language works in the wild!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auxiliary languages tend not to be classified as a priori simply because they impose layers of difficulty that run contrary to the usual design parameters of the genre. However, it can potentially be argued that a priori invented languages can become auxiliary languages after a fashion and if the appropriate stars align. For example, it may be that Klingon has seen some use as an ad hoc auxiliary language if, for example, two groups of Star Trek fans who do not share a language in common other than Klingon happen to meet at a SciFi convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, even if there were an actual auxiliary language that is classified as purely a priori, it certainly isn't famous. Otherwise, we'd know about it!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;We will have to go back some centuries in time to find a language like this. Since the success of Esperanto (and, to a lesser degree Interlingua, Glosa, and Toki Pona) it seems to be clear that an auxiliary language has to be naturalistic in some way to catch on. Nowadays, a priory languages (e.g., Loglan and its forks) are only designed with other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, probably &lt;a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solresol" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Solresol (1817)&lt;/a&gt; is the most famous a priory auxiliary language.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, many existing languages do, albeit in a limited manner. In Spanish, for example, all nouns and pronouns are gendered; either male or female. This enforces the idea that all people are either male or female—which is not true. Your world might have two groups of people and the second group can only be described as 'inferiors' in the language; there is no other word. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I've read that the most commonly used verbs in a language are almost always irregular, and for the most part the irregular forms of verbs can be traced to an archaic form being preserved in the language, or to the influence of other languages. 
When creating a naturalistic conlang, what verbs should be irregular? I'm already aware that 'to be' is almost always irregular, but are there any general patterns for which verbs are most often irregular in a natlang? (For example, are verbs involving movement more commonly irregular than not?)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Well, the statement is demonstrably untrue. Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese) doesn't have irregular verbs, because verbs aren't conjugated. Quechua doesn't have any. And languages like Inuktitut has no irregularity in verbs because of the way that the language assembles words based on a root+affixes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The first class of verbs that is often highly irregular are the auxiliary verbs. This does not only comprise &lt;em&gt;to be&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;to have&lt;/em&gt; but also the modal auxiliaries (like &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;shall&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt;). They are used very frequently and tend to erode phonetically, and they are also prone to suppletion (showing a mixture of different stems from originally different words).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick check (for my native language German) seems to confirm your intuition that verbs of motion are more often irregular than average. They are also used quite frequently. In Romance languages, the basic verb for &lt;em&gt;to go&lt;/em&gt; (e.g., French &lt;em&gt;aller&lt;/em&gt; or Italian &lt;em&gt;andare&lt;/em&gt;) is very irregular and mixing several different stems ((vulgar) Latin &lt;em&gt;ambulare/allare, vadere, ire&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some verbs are irregular because they rhyme with an irregular verb, e.g., German &lt;em&gt;schreiben, schrieb, geschrieben&lt;/em&gt; "to write", borrowed from Latin &lt;em&gt;scribere&lt;/em&gt;, became irregular because of rhyming verbs like &lt;em&gt;bleiben&lt;/em&gt; "to stay".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;My reply is going to look a lot sillier in comparison, but I suggest taking inspiration from the shapes of a large collection of items. I've seen conlangs use alphabets inspired by mushrooms and flowers, but you could try constellations, animals, fruits, street signs, soda brand logos, anything to get you inspired. Here's my silly attempt using emojis for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l9Yai.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l9Yai.png" alt="emoji-inspired alphabet"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've drawn say 50 symbols, you can start filtering out the ones that look too different or those which just wouldn't be natural to write using a pen, brush, quill or whatever your fictional society uses. Try writing words using these symbols and you'll see which ones are too tricky to write and need simplifying, and which ones are too close to tell apart.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;My reply is going to look a lot sillier in comparison, but I suggest taking inspiration from the shapes of a large collection of items.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;You may be interested in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;E-Prime&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E-Prime&lt;/em&gt; is a version of English that excludes all forms of the verb &lt;strong&gt;to be&lt;/strong&gt;, including all conjugations, contractions and archaic forms. This makes many objective statements like "Roses are red" impossible. Instead a person is required to use more subjective constructions like "Roses appear red to me".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Most conlang examples I find in tutorials use a small set of vowels, but the one I'm working on has 13 and I'm having trouble finding the simplest transliteration to work with. Here are the IPA symbols:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Front    | Back
---------|----------
[i]      | [u]  
[y]      |
---------|---------
[e]      | [o]
[ø]      |
---------|---------
[aɛ̯]     |
[œ]      |
---------|---------
[a]      | [ɑ]
---------|---------
[œ̃]      | [õ]
[ã]      |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My keyboard only allows me to type àâäùûüèêëéìîï but not œɛɑø or the diacritics used in the IPA for nasal vowels and diphthongs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(EDIT: Note that my question really is all about the transliteration I'll be using for practical typing. Sure, I can just use fancy unicode symbols for my actual writing system in the end if I want to, but copypasting symbols isn't very practical for writing long texts.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language uses a (very simplified) subset of Quebec French for sound inventory, but I wanted to avoid using too many digraphs or diacritics which French relies on heavily. I know I can always come up with a custom font and writing system later on which brings in more glyphs for vowels, but I need something practical to use during conception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd be interested if you have a generic answer as to what your own process is when you have a similar problem or a specific suggestion in my case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My incomplete solution for now is this (&lt;strong&gt;updated to include jknappen's suggestion which I like for the German-style umlaut&lt;/strong&gt;). I could add a macro to my text editor to allow for tildes, but I still need to figure out how I want to distinguish [œ] and [e] or [a] and [ɑ].&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One possibility is to use German-style umlauts, i.e., &lt;em&gt;ü&lt;/em&gt; for /y/, &lt;em&gt;ö&lt;/em&gt; for /ø/, and &lt;em&gt;ä&lt;/em&gt; for /æ/; you can keep the symbol &lt;em&gt;œ&lt;/em&gt; for /œ/. I'd recommend against having both &lt;em&gt;ae&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;œ&lt;/em&gt; in the writing system because of confusability. The choice of tilde for nasalisation is a good one, IMO. The most problematic case are the two different kinds of a-sounds, but there are some African languages just going with a and ɑ (and there is also an uppercase letter for the ɑ in Unicode, it is named &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alpha" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Latin Alpha&lt;/a&gt;). All the symbols are readily available in Unicode and should not pose insurmountable difficulties in text processing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are. There is a language called Silbo that is whistled and not spoken. There are around 70 whistled languages in the world. They're mostly for conveying words long distances. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In languages with conjugated verbs there is usually a similar structure across verbs that makes them easy to recognize even if you do not know the word. For example in German, all verbs after the pronoun 'Sie' end with 'en' which makes them easy to recognize. This is compounded by the fact that verbs are in second position, making the verb in a sentence very easy to pick out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my language verbs are not conjugated, nor do they have tense. The way the language is structured, there can be multiple verbs per sentence, and it would make the language easier to parse if verbs could be picked out easily. I also worry that similar sounding nouns will become easy to confuse with verbs as I grow my dictionary, which would be nice to avoid completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I considered making all verbs have a particular ending, but this quickly gets repetitive and breaks up sentence flow since the sound will be made several times in one sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What strategies can I adopt to make the verbs recognizable as verbs even if the reader/listener does not already know the specific verb being used? &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In Lojban, cmevla (proper nouns, like .alis.) are the only words ending in a consonant. Depending on how big your vowel inventory is, you could make all verbs end in a vowel and everything else end in a consonant. That way, they are easy to pick out and still provide much variety.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To generalize that, you could just take the last sound of a verb from any distinct group of sounds, like nasals, fricatives or labiliased consonants ("labialiseds"?). One could also use that to make word correspondences, e.g. nominalization changing the verb's final sound to the corresponding nasal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also mentioned position in the sentence. Having the verb in a specific position (first, last, second, etc.) is a good way to distinguish them, but depending on your language, dependent clauses could get difficult.&lt;br&gt;
Of course, coupling position in sentence with a specific ending sound provides a nice way to recognize sentence borders. There, one could again use the ending sound kind to modify the verb to signify a dependent clause.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;What you want to avoid the most is to have too many rhyming words. A rhyme occurs when the last vowel and any consonants following it are the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could end all verbs using the same consonant or consonant cluster. This would also give you an easy way to form verbs from nouns and nouns or adjectives from verbs: just add a suffix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of just ending all verbs with one ending, you could also have a small set of possible endings - which could carry some meaning too. Or you could simply forbid all consonant clusters in your language &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; when a word is formed by adding to a previous verb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say our language uses &lt;code&gt;-ct&lt;/code&gt; for intransitive verbs and &lt;code&gt;-st&lt;/code&gt; for verbs that imply causality - the subject causes something to the object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The noun &lt;em&gt;vis&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;strong&gt;life&lt;/strong&gt;, the verb &lt;em&gt;visect&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;strong&gt;to live&lt;/strong&gt; and the adjective &lt;em&gt;visecti&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;strong&gt;alive&lt;/strong&gt;.
By extension, &lt;em&gt;avisecti&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;strong&gt;dead&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;avisectist&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;strong&gt;to cause death&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;On my computer I have a &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;custom keyboard setup&lt;/a&gt; that allows me to enter all sorts of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_Diacritical_Marks" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;combining diacritics&lt;/a&gt;. This allows you to make combinations that are usually not present, including multiple diacritics on the same letter. The only downside to this is that they do not render well in some fonts. I'll give some examples of what I can do with my keyboard setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;umlaut with a: ä &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;circumflex with e: ê &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;macron over u: ū&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;acute and under ring with o: ó̥&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;caron above and below i: ǐ̬&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of options, see the wikipedia page I linked above for all of the different options. To type them you just need to press ctrl-alt with whatever you assign the key to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are several options; the most obvious ones I can think of are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Position: In Hawai'an (and Klingon), the verb is at the initial position of the clause. If there are multiple clauses in a complex sentence, you will need to mark the clause boundaries in some way, eg through punctuation or use of specific conjunctions. So you can put anything in that place, and it will be interpreted as a verb: &lt;em&gt;'Ono&lt;/em&gt; means "delicious" as an adjective, in &lt;em&gt;'Ono ka hua moa&lt;/em&gt; it is used as a verb to mean "the egg is delicious". That also might solve problems when you later grow your lexicon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markers: In toki pona, the verb is always in second position in a clause, and is separated from the subject (which is in first position) through the particle &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt;. So the sentence &lt;em&gt;waso li lape&lt;/em&gt; can be parsed as &lt;em&gt;waso&lt;/em&gt; - subject, &lt;em&gt;lape&lt;/em&gt; - verb, even if you have no clue what the words actually mean ("bird" and "to sleep" respectively) Note: the personal pronouns &lt;em&gt;mi&lt;/em&gt; ans &lt;em&gt;sina&lt;/em&gt; are an exception to this rule, as they are not followed by &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Lape&lt;/em&gt; can also be a noun ("the sleep"). Transitive verbs are separated by &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; from the object, which again helps identifying the sentence structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morphology: if you want to avoid repetitive sounds, you can nominate different verb endings (or prefixes) to either introduce variation for variation's sake, or to indicate other features (number, tense, aspect, modality, ...) While Esperanto uses a limited set of verb endings indicating (mostly) tense, it does not sound repetitive. If your verbs are not marked for grammatical features, morphology obviously is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The more used a verb is, the more likely it is to resist evolution. So the most popular verbs are likely to be the most odd. Think of the activities which were more common during the evolution of the language. A conlang spoken by a prosperous society might have more irregular verbs related to possession, social interactions and art - while a conlang spoken by nomads living in a land with cataclysmic climate would have more irregular verbs about natural phenomenons and actions that everyone has to perform in order to guarantee their survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that verbs can have varying degrees of regularity. English has a pretty clean system, with a few boldly irregular verbs, a decent list of somewhat irregular verbs and a lot of very regular verbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, French verbs tend to be split across different groups based on their ending. There's -er, -ir, -oir and -re. Verbs within one group tend to have similar conjugations. Still, there is so much irregularity in French verbs that students often refer to verb conjugation volumes that have the full conjugation of about 100 model verbs. At the end of those volumes is a list of all French verbs with the page number of the most similar model verb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: scrolling through the list of model verbs in a &lt;em&gt;Bescherelles&lt;/em&gt; conjugation volume, those are the verbs which seem less regular to me (native French speaker):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to be - être (also an auxiliary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to have - avoir (also an auxiliary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to go - aller (sometimes used as an auxiliary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to die - mourrir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to know - savoir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;must - falloir (it's a whole verb in French)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can - pouvoir (it's a whole verb in French)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to have a duty [to do something] - devoir (mostly used as an auxiliary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to be of value - valoir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to want - vouloir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to rain - pleuvoir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to drink - boire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to do / to make - faire (not an auxiliary in French)&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Erosion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the emoji suggestion above, but I have a similar suggestion, and that's to start with simple line pictures of the things represented.  In other words, follow the same kind of evolution that produced today's "Roman" alphabet.  It's been known to happen that way, independently, more than twice (proto-Canaanite, Linear A, and Mayan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take simple little line drawings and then erode them until you have just a few manageable strokes per letter (or syllable, or whatever).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Cloud, Stars, Light, and Shadow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another source of inspiration is to watch the clouds for useful patterns, or connect the dots of particular stars, or look at interesting light patterns filtering through curtains at night (for example), or watch the interplay of light and shadow under trees (for another example).  Sometimes you'll get a GREAT and unexpected source of inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I know that Slovio is not very popular but if I write or speak in this language, will I be understood by Russian or Ukrainian as their website says?
If someone has experience to share, it helps me to decide if I should learn this conlang.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, I’ve been conlanging ‘properly’ for around two to two and a half years now and have been into it for far, far longer. However, I have yet to create a conlang that is truly in-depth, detailed, and realistic. I soon want to begin that process. I am confident in my knowledge of linguistics and have at least a basic knowledge of most areas and a more in-depth knowledge of others (none the less, I am still an amateur of linguistics, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The current situation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I am in the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; early stages of planning – I’ve yet to decide on the final concept which I am going to develop. My ideas currently on the shortlist are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Celtic language spoken on a (fictional) island nation off the north-western coast of Ireland with North-Germanic influence due to interactions and mixing with the Norse people throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Turkic language spoken in a (fictional) nation in the Southern Caucasus with influence from Georgen, especially on the phonology and vocabulary side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Uralic language spoken in Eastern Finland and the Karelia/Murmansk regions with Slavic influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these ideas, I am currently most drawn towards the first bullet-point, however, choosing the scenario of the conlang is not the crux of the issue. That is the issue of creating an in-depth &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; realistic, believable a posteriori conlang. I want to create a language that has detailed and believable phonology and grammar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My questions to you&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your advice on creating a good a posteriori conlang in general?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do I effectively develop a conlang with as much detail and depth as possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for any help or guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;So, you are going to create an altlang (a naturalistic language living in an alternate history of the the world). First, define your starting point (easiest for the first scenario: Old Irish or proto-Goidelic is a suitable starting point for this one). Look at the real world descendants from that starting points (Middle Irish and Modern Irish, Manx, Scottish Gaelish) and what changes happened to them. You can create variation by retaining some archaic features, applying changes from different descendants, or applying changes in different temporal order to create a new artificial Goidelic language. You may also throw in some original changes not occurring in the known Goidelic languages. Keep a timeline of those changes—the changes will apply to loan words as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Than decide on the influence of the other language: Are there only borrowings of words, shall it influence syntax (e.g., the order of noun and genitive or noun and adjective, shall the basic word order change?), are there new phonemes added to the phonology? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decide, when the influence happens, does it happen only once, are there several waves of influence. Note that the other language changes over time, too. Your conlang may preserve archaic words from the donor language that have fallen out of use or have undergone sound shifts there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put everything together and enjoy the result!&lt;/p&gt;

Look at the real world descendants from that starting points (Middle Irish and Modern Irish, Manx, Scottish Gaelish) and what changes happened to them. You can create variation by retaining some archaic features, applying changes from different descendants, or applying changes in different temporal order to create a new artificial Goidelic language. You may also throw in some original changes not occurring in the known Goidelic languages. Keep a timeline of those changes—the changes will apply to loan words as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Than decide on the influence of the other language: Are there only borrowings of words, shall it influence syntax (e.g., the order of noun and genitive or noun and adjective, shall the basic word order change?), are there new phonemes added to the phonology? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decide, when the influence happens, does it happen only once, are there several waves of influence. Note that the other language changes over time, too. Your conlang may preserve archaic words from the donor language that have fallen out of use or have undergone sound shifts there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put everything together and enjoy the result!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Have you looked at Brithenig or Wenedyk?  These were generated by applying to Latin the sound shifts that affected Welsh and Polish (respectively) over the same period.  You could start with early Irish and apply Scandinavian sound changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there would also be lexical and syntactic borrowings; those are less systematic by nature, and so can be governed more by your taste. Do you know the concept of &lt;em&gt;Sprachbund&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another hand, aren't there natlangs with at least some of the features you want?  Scandinavians ruled parts of Ireland; Russia rules over some Uralic peoples; there are Turkic languages adjacent to Georgia — I would expect some influence.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I read that Interslavic and Neoslavonic merged into a single language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All three projects collaborated closely with each other from that time, and in 2011 Medžuslovjanski („Interslavic”) was chosen as a common name. Fruits of this cooperation were, among other things, a common dictionary, a common news portal and a common wiki. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder why there is two websites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://steen.free.fr/interslavic" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://steen.free.fr/interslavic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.neoslavonic.org" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://www.neoslavonic.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any difference in the grammar? If so, which one is the most popular?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Have there been any attempts to create a language based on Proto-Indo-European (PIE)? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course PIE has had an effect on other languages, and through them ended up in many a posteriori conlangs as well. What I mean is whether there have been any attempts to create a usable language based on what we know of PIE and filling in the blanks with conlangery. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago (about 2) these two projects united into the single one called Interslavic (2-nd version). So, since then it's a common project with unified grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before it they were slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a language with &lt;strong&gt;nominal tense–aspect–mood&lt;/strong&gt; (TAM), i.e. inflecting nouns instead of verbs. So, a sentence like "the woman sees the man", could be roughly translated to something like "the woman&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt; see the man".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of sentence shows an ergative-absolutive morphosyntactic alignment: the subject of a transitive sentence is marked (ergative case), while the direct object is unmarked (absolutive case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like the idea of &lt;strong&gt;removing verbs as a class (since tense, aspect and mood can be expressed by the subject&lt;/strong&gt;) and "reclassify" those words as nouns. So "the woman&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt; see the man" could actually mean something like "the woman &lt;em&gt;makes sight of&lt;/em&gt; the man", in the sense of "making eye contact". In other words, having &lt;strong&gt;ungrammaticalized verbs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the actual translation for "the woman sees the man" would be "the woman&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt; sight the man". And that's the problem: "sight" and "man" are both unmarked nouns, leading to misinterpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is: &lt;strong&gt;does the language need a marking for the direct object&lt;/strong&gt; (accusative case), having then a tripartite alignment? Or can I simply get away with &lt;strong&gt;only TAM marking&lt;/strong&gt; (absolutive case) and &lt;strong&gt;no markings for verbs or direct objects&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the feeling that I'm forgetting something. I think that the idea of "not having verbs" makes sense to me, since many languages like English, French or Spanish actually lack of inflections and employ only word order, but I might be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...sight is a verb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to have a verbless phrase, you'd want something like "the man within the woman's sight", making it clear you're using the noun "sight" and not the verb "sight".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, and I've seen this pointed out, if you end up needing particular constructions in order to indicate actions, all you're doing is making an overly complicated verb.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am planning a naturalistic Goidelic language which shall have quite an influence from Old Norse – probably at least 1/4 or 1/3 of the vocabulary to be of North Germanic origin, as well as a mostly undecided, but lesser influence on the phonology and grammar. Despite the North Germanic influence, I would still like to retain a ‘broad-slender’ vowel system, lenition, eclipsis, and (possibly) prothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, although I intend for the Old Norse influence to be less focused on grammar, I came up with the idea of, instead of deriving from the Old Irish definite article &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; and having it work similarly to the other Goidelic languages, I could derive from the Old Norse clitic article &lt;em&gt;-inn&lt;/em&gt; and instead use this style of clitic article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Questions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would the retention of broad-slender vowels and consonant mutations be possible and at least somewhat naturalistic in this scenario?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would the replacement of the Goidelic definite article with an Old Norse-style clitic definite article be possible and at least somewhat naturalistic in this scenario?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an extension to this question – would it be realistic to retain the different Old Norse articles for the different genders (&lt;em&gt;-inn&lt;/em&gt; for masculine nom., &lt;em&gt;-in&lt;/em&gt; for feminine nom., and &lt;em&gt;-it&lt;/em&gt; for neuter nom.) as well as the different cases (for example, &lt;em&gt;-innar&lt;/em&gt; for feminine genitive singular) or to just keep one or two articles (such as to just derive from &lt;em&gt;-inn&lt;/em&gt; for all the definite articles in my language), regardless of the gender or case?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Yes, the whole thing looks naturalistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ad 1) When you assimilate the Old Norse words to a Goidelic phonetic system, lenitions and broad/slender distinctions come in very naturally. It will be more difficult when you insist on some Old Norse sounds sticking out of the Goidelic system; they can form exceptions to the lenition rules or evolve specific lenitions of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ad 2) Retaining the Old Norse suffixed article is definitely an option, and simplifying it to only one form (independent of gender, case, and number) looks most natuaral to me, but keeping the inflected forms is also covered by your artistic license as a conlang author. Or you may inflect the definite forms according to Goidelic inflectional rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I think you are looking for the constructed language called &lt;a href="https://mw.lojban.org/papri/The_Complete_Lojban_Language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lojban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an earlier reference to its &lt;a href="http://lojban.org/publications/reference_grammar/chapter10.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;grammar&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Technical note for readers conversant with relativity theory: The Lojban time tenses reflect time as seen by the speaker, who is assumed to be a ``point-like observer'' in the relativistic sense: they do not say anything about physical relationships of relativistic interval, still less about implicit causality. The nature of tense is not only subjective but also observer-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a specific reference to its use of a "&lt;a href="https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Relativistic_tense_in_Lojban" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;relativistic tense&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There's been a proposal to have words expressing relativistic tenses that are different &gt; from usual past, current and future used in most historical natural languages.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;How this 4th tense would work? Consider we are 3 light years away from a star that explodes. And in 3 years we see the explosion. So what? How do we use this 4th tense?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It would be a tag with a modifier ue'ei.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;ue'ei = [MOhI] 4th relativistic tense modifier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also an interesting set of charts describing in detail the use of &lt;a href="https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Relativity_theory_in_Lojban" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;relativity theory in Lojban&lt;/a&gt; on the current lojban language site.
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KTQ7k.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KTQ7k.png" alt="Lojban Relativistic tense chart"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in the &lt;a href="http://lojban.github.io/cll/10/1/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lojban Reference Grammar site&lt;/a&gt;, there is this little intriguing tidbit on Lojban tense usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In Lojban, the concept of tense extends to every selbri, not merely the verb-like ones. In addition, tense structures provide information about location in space as well as in time. All tense information is optional in Lojban&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Depends on how you look at it; the Interslavic page does say (as you have noticed) that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All three projects collaborated closely with each other from that time, and in 2011 Medžuslovjanski („Interslavic”) was chosen as a common name. Fruits of this cooperation were, among other things, a common dictionary, a common news portal and a common wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/history.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;History of Interslavic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, historically speaking, they are two different projects (plus a third one) that have coalesced into one, and are now one project with some internal variation. The websites are continuations of their individual parent projects, as each team retained its independence from the new fused project.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Maybe you're using nouns as instrumentals... so can you have noun cases, i.e. an instrumental case to distinguish whether a noun is the Object versus the Instrument?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I'm not sure that that necessarily makes the Instrumental Noun just a complicated verb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Woman-SUBJ+TAM Man-OBJ Eye-INST&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Woman's (focus?) [is] on the Man via (her) Eye".&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a fixed word order, no case markings are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or TAM could potentially mark the subject.  Instrumentals could be chained after the object, making them feel just a bit like adjectives or adverbs or something.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I've created a race of nomadic robots, but am having trouble finding a culture to base their language off of. They're peripatetic nomads, meaning they travel around offering goods and services to any friendly people they come across, but most nomadic peoples of this style either use the languages of their country, or the language is too fluid and natural to be suited for machines. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;How about Polynesian languages? The people travelled far distances, their culture was very spread out, and they don't really have a country that 'owns' the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further positive aspect is that you can pick up basic Hawai'ian on Duolingo; this quickly gives you a feel for the language. It's VSO, so sounds unusual enough to Western cultures who are more used to SVO. It would also be very plausible for machines who might process knowledge in predicate calculus (as in &lt;code&gt;eats(cow, grass)&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vocabulary has a strong English influence, due to the colonialisation by the Americans, who made teaching the language illegal, but you will probably adapt that anyway to choose your own words.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I've got most of Mark Rosenfelder's books on conlanging except &lt;em&gt;The Syntax Construction Kit&lt;/em&gt; (which I'm not sure I need). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conlang I'm currently working on is a 'holy musical magic language' called Fae Spraesh which is developing differently than my other projects - it's Tolkienesque, while my other (mostly undeveloped) conlangs are mostly fictional blends of particular real-world languages and thus not Tolkienesque at all. I have no plans to study university linguistics, and I'm not looking to develop a Fae Spraesh writing system at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does &lt;em&gt;The Syntax Construction Kit&lt;/em&gt; cover any new material that might be useful to my conlanging, or do Mark Rosenfelder's other books (&lt;em&gt;Language Construction Kit&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Advanced Language Construction Kit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Conlanger's Lexipedia&lt;/em&gt;) and David J. Peterson‘s &lt;em&gt;The Art of Language Invention&lt;/em&gt; suffice?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I will attempt to answer this question, despite not having read the book, so please take my advice with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the website of the book, &lt;a href="http://zompist.com/syntax.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;zompist.com/syntax.html&lt;/a&gt;, you can see an outline of the contents. Rosenfelder describes the book as "a tour of modern syntax".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a linguist myself, it looks like the book I'd loved to have had while at university. It covers (English) syntactic theory in a way that looks interesting and not simply dry and theoretical -- he supplements the book by a set of interactive tools to develop your own grammars based on the theoretical ideas of Chomsky and others. He does follow a particular strand of syntactic theory, which is mainly common in the US, not so much in the UK, but he also covers some alternatives to the Chomskyan approach. Rosenfelder's own view of Chomsky is nuanced and somewhat sceptical: he has an essay on this on his website (which I wholeheartedly agree with). Note, however, that this is about English, and these formalisms have been developed by linguists working mostly with English, so if your conlang is very different, they might not easily apply to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from Chomskyan &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_grammar" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Generative Grammar&lt;/a&gt;, he also talks about &lt;a href="http://zompist.com/markov.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Markov text generators&lt;/a&gt;, which would be useful to generate (random) texts in a given language. This might be a useful tool to practically explore your conlang: generate some text, and try to translate it. Several other tools are also aimed at generating sentences, rather than just analysing them. The meaning is often a bit random (as it is not really controlled), but at least the grammar will be correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is basically a syntax textbook, which will introduce you to syntactic theories while playing around with the formalisms and actively doing syntax (which to me is the best way of learning about them!) If you are interested in grammar, and the formal properties of different types of grammars, this looks like an ideal book. In fact, I have put it on my wishlist with a well-known on-line book retailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if all you want to do is build a smallish conlang, which might not even have a very complicated grammar, then this book looks like overkill to me. On the site he mentions that there is "a chapter on how you can apply all this to your conlangs". So conlangs are not really the focus of the book, but more a possible application of the described syntactic apparatus to invented languages. I would assume -- from the description on the webpage -- that this is a fairly advanced book, which is great for linguistics students and  for serious conlangers who want to make use of sophisticated formalisms when describing their languages. In that sense it will not cover too much of the same ground as his more 'applied'/'practical' books about language creation. If the previous books have kindled an interest in linguistics, though, and you want to know more about approaches to syntactic description, then this might be the book for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;At the moment I have 90 unique vowel/diphthong sounds that use tonal and length distinction in my conlang. In addition I've chosen 14 consonants, making my total of unique sounds 104.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't particularly want to drop any of them, but this seems a lot higher than the usual amount of unique sounds in a language. High enough to consider a more selective approach maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do want the language to have more vowel sounds than consonant, but how many unique vowel sounds does it have to have to be considered above average?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Depends what you want to do. If you want to be able to emulate all the words of real languages, add the whole IPA system. If you want nice melodic options, add in accordance with your preferred music system (Asian 5 tone, Western 7 tone, Modern 12 tone, each with steps and variations, and repeating form 20 Hz up to 20 000 Hz) and for each possible sound humans can produce - different voiced and voiceless sounds, whispered (ha) or normal (a), and so on. If you want to actually use it and keep it independent of other languages, I suggest keeping it simple - a movie language, for instance, is more effectful if you only choose in-character sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, you get a lot more sounds even in English and Italian if you include unusual words, regional dialects and so on - a large part of the IPA phonemes can be used in either language, though people often don't notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here a few different English vowels (all mainstream):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hut
Hat
Heroic
Hellenic
Hmmmh
Hit
Here
Hot
Hotel
Herd
Hoover&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpha
And
Entity
About
e-in-Garden
India
Equal

Over&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi
How
Hey
Hoist
Holy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's 32 distinct sounds. Some might be debatable, they are also dependent on dialect - "and" and "entity" start with the same sound for some, but I hear a difference - at least in some regions. The e in "Garden" isn't a sound at all according to some. And so on. The version on Wikipedia (English phonology) is slightly different. "Ha" is even in IPA written as two sounds, though it clearly is one sound (a whispered "a"), as you can see when stretching it, with or without adding a letter afterwards. I even ommitted a few vowels only the British/Australian/Canadian people use. According to Google, US English has 14-16 vowel phonemes, Australian English 20-21. And the whispered variety isn't even included. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you multiply by three for tonal (add Up like we do in questions and Down like we do in some forms of emphasis or sounding defeated), you get 96. Asia also has a wavering tonal, but that can be emulated with two letters imo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you multiply by two for 2 different lengths, you get 192. If we ignore the h-sounds, we are still at 96.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what you have is not that much.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;If you have ninety vowels (including diphthongs), I'd say your invented language is already above average. English is probably at the higher end of the vowel spectrum with twentyish; but there are plenty of languages with far fewer (as few as two or three!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since your title question references invented languages specifically, you might consider trawling the &lt;a href="http://cals.conlang.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;CALS&lt;/a&gt; to find an approximation. Not every invented language is listed, so naturally the data &amp; results can not be seen as accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I speak Finnish, which is one of the more vowel-oriented languages.  Considering the 8 vowels, diphthongs, double-vowel (long) sounds... there's probably 2-3 dozen vowel sounds.  90 not only feels like overkill, but I wonder how effectively anyone could distinguish that many sounds.  It's like asking someone to involve all the sounds in 5-6 U.S. dialects all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;90 different vowels sounds a lot, but you include tone as a distinguishing feature. I don't know how many tone/length distinctions you have, but some natural languages have 6 tones. This brings the number of different vowel qualities down to 15 which is still a large number, but in the range of natural languages (German and Norwegian are in that range).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14 consonants is a rather moderate size for a consonant system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on consonant and vowel inventories of natural languages you can consult the &lt;a href="https://wals.info/chapter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;World Atlas of Linguistic Structures&lt;/a&gt; specially chapters 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Express probabilities&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of saying "It appears that…" or "I think that…" your elves could express how certain they are in exact numerical terms: "I believe with a 65±6% probability that…" By default, a sentence conveys a confidence level of 80%, let's say. If people want to express a greater level of confidence than that, they have to explicitly say it; we don't want it to be too easy for people to be overconfident. Of course, this is a pretty clunky statement in English; in your language it could be as simple as "65% that…".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the speaker can state their evidence for their statement: "…based on the evidence of its physical appearance", "…based on the impression it gives me", etc. To be extra precise, the speaker could state their prior probability and go through their calculations for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Bayes' theorem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going beyond language and more about culture, but perhaps every elf could be scored on whether their stated probabilities turned out to be accurate, neither overconfident nor underconfident; e.g., 70% of their "it is 70% like that…" statements turned out to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Clearly define words&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a simple sentence like "The girl is good" is ambiguous. Does that mean she is morally good, and if so, is that according to the standard of virtue ethics (virtuous), deontology (follows all the rules), or consequentialism (has a positive impact on the word)? Does it mean that she is obedient, and if so, does that mean she obeys orders? What percent of the time does she obey orders? Does it mean that she ranks in the 80th percentile of children her age in terms of obedience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sorts of questions could be resolved by a standard prescriptive dictionary which everyone must read. Sentences should use words by their dictionary definition as literally as possible, and listeners should interpret it literally. If any speaker deviates from that dictionary definition, they should say so explicitly. You could have a prefix or suffix indicating that a word is being used inexactly or metaphorically.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;h1&gt;Express probabilities&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of saying "It appears that…" or "I think that…" your elves could express how certain they are in exact numerical terms: "I believe with a 65±6% probability that…" By default, a sentence conveys a confidence level of 80%, let's say. If people want to express a greater level of confidence than that, they have to explicitly say it; we don't want it to be too easy for people to be overconfident. Of course, this is a pretty clunky statement in English; in your language it could be as simple as "65% that…".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;We can have two classes of nouns: souls, and the perceptions and ideas of souls. Ideas nouns must be inflected for who they are being perceived by: you, God, or whoever. This would have the effect of turning a sentence like "The dog is red" into "The dog seems red to me."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, instead of saying "The dog…" or "There is a dog…", you would say "I have the idea of a dog that…" Then to refer to that dog again, instead of using a pronoun like "it", you could say something like "my aforementioned dog idea". Idea nouns could exist only in a sort of object case, and not as a subject, to make speaking about it directly as if it really existed out there ungrammatical.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangut_script" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Tangut script&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a more pure logographic writing system, with only 10% of the characters having a phonetic component. The Tangut script was created in 1036 by one person, apparently &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; but inspired by Chinese, and used until to 1502. So far, 5863 characters are known, excluding variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tangut characters are extremely complicated, but they're probably unnecessarily so. Blissymbolics, which is an ideographic writing system with much simpler characters, has over 5,000 official symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating a couple hundred root characters, I feel like you create a character for a new word in a couple of seconds by combining the meaning of existing characters. If Toki Pona can build a full vocabulary with 120 morphemes, you should be able to do the same with a logographic writing system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;We can make a noun for the instrument of an action, by taking the verb for the action and adding an &lt;strong&gt;instrumental&lt;/strong&gt; marker.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in English, we can add "-er",&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;cut&lt;/strong&gt; the box with a box-&lt;strong&gt;cutter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, we can make a verb for an action, by taking the noun for the instrument and adding... &lt;strong&gt;what could you call it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In English, we don't necessarily have an affix, since we can just verbalise the noun, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will &lt;strong&gt;knife&lt;/strong&gt; you with my &lt;strong&gt;knife&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...but we might use "-ise" this way, at least jocularly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will &lt;strong&gt;hammerise&lt;/strong&gt; him if he comes at me with that knife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is there a term for such a marker, indicating the &lt;strong&gt;use&lt;/strong&gt; of an instrument? "Usive"? "Usual"?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] I was going to call this "instrumentive", on the pattern of "agentive" and "patientive", but the word doesn't appear in any dictionary I checked. It is used in some books on linguistics, though, per Google Books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] This is also the agentive suffix in English, but I'm imagining a scenario where the agent and the instrument are clearly distinguished.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s not a grammatical sentence and the context doesn’t provide any clue about how to fill it out if it’s an abbreviated one.  Not ure where “folklore” came from (well, ‘pona sona’ but how?) and the rest is is a single noun phrase that I cannot render into English in an intelligible way, though it does apparently belong to the assistant chief of Atlantis.
I have no suggestions about how to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I think you're conflating a/o confusing a couple different things here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, "cutter" is not "instrumental". (At least in English!) In English grammar, &lt;strong&gt;-er&lt;/strong&gt; is (among zillions of other uses) the morpheme that indicates "agent noun"; so, &lt;em&gt;cutter&lt;/em&gt; means "thing that cuts". It is the actual agent by which cutting happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_case" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Instrumental Case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a grammatical function that indicates the means by which the agent or subject of the verb does the action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I-subj cut-verb the.box-obj (with.a.box.cutter)-instr.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If English had case endings like Latin, you could see the difference easily:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puer-NOM cistam-ACC cultello-ABL secavit-VERB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latin uses the ablative case to denote the instrumental case, due to ancient case syncretism of the old ablative, locative and instrumental cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ize" rel="noreferrer"&gt;-ise / -ize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, in English, is a grammatical morpheme that indicates the word is a denominal verb. This means that the verb in question is made from a noun. We already know that English weirds. It verbs nouns at the drop of a hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will &lt;strong&gt;hammer&lt;/strong&gt; him if he attacks me with the knife.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your example, "I will hammerise him if he attacks me with a knife", doesn't actually make sense in context. This is because &lt;strong&gt;-ise&lt;/strong&gt; doesn't mean "use something as an instrument", it means "turn something into something else".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigrants ought to be &lt;em&gt;Americanised&lt;/em&gt; through educational programmes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The machine &lt;em&gt;pulverises&lt;/em&gt; large pieces of stone into gravel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think your best bet, as far as "converse" of or "opposite" of the instrumental case, would be the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;noninstrumental case&lt;/strong&gt;, which I just made up.  It does what the instrumental case does, only in the other direction. Essentially, the speaker denies the instrumentality of the named article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puer-NOM cistam-ACC cultellei-NONINST secavit-VERB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I considered "deinstrumental", but that's already a thing (a noun or verb made upon an instrumental form).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;If I said "I" was "Zha" would it be plausible to say "you" is "Zho" and from there naturally begin forming grammatical gender, or would that be too early in the language to add complexities? Also, could the word "we" not be a root word but instead be derived from "I" (Zha-&gt;Zhasa)?&lt;/p&gt;

Also, could the word "we" not be a root word but instead be derived from "I" (Zha-&gt;Zhasa)?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Sure. And like always, real languages got there first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Quechua, for instance, fist person singular ("I/me") is &lt;em&gt;Ñuqa&lt;/em&gt;. 1st person plural inclusive (we, all of us) is &lt;em&gt;Ñuqanchik&lt;/em&gt;, and exclusive (us, but not you) is &lt;em&gt;Ñuqayku&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second person singular is &lt;em&gt;Qam&lt;/em&gt;, plural &lt;em&gt;Qamkuna&lt;/em&gt;. Third person singular is &lt;em&gt;Pay&lt;/em&gt;, third person plural &lt;em&gt;Paykuna&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;-kuna&lt;/em&gt; is simply the Quechuan plural suffix. "House" is &lt;em&gt;wasi&lt;/em&gt;, "houses" &lt;em&gt;wasikuna&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You, the person I'm talking to" &lt;em&gt;Qam&lt;/em&gt;, "You, the people I'm talking to" &lt;em&gt;Qamkuna&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's quite common in many languages that "I" and "you" are distinct; after all, I'm usually the most most important person in the universe, and you just live there. Third person pronouns seem to often be derived from pointing words: "that thing over there" becomes "that person over there".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I ended up using the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Front  |          |   Back
---------|----------|-----------
[i]  /i/ |          | [u]  /u/
[y]  /ü/ |          |
---------|----------|-----------
[e]  /e/ |          | [o]  /o/
[ø]  /ë/ |          | [õ]  /õ/
---------|----------|-----------
[aɛ̯] /á/ |          |
[œ]  /œ/ |          |
[œ̃]  /ĩ/ |          |
---------|----------|-----------
         | [a]  /a/ | [ɑː] /aa/
         | [ɑ̃]  /ã/ |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many vowel variants were written using something similar to the German umlaut following jknappen's recommendation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ĩ, ã, õ and œ were chosen because they work in many fonts and are close to their IPA representation. I set up an AutoHotkey script to allow typing them easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really didn't want to introduce a diacritic to represent [ɑ], so I just made that sound longer so it makes sense to represent it with /aa/. This will make it easier to tell apart too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; After reading the beginning of Mark Rosenfelder's LCK again, his warning about the same diacritic having more than one meaning made me realize using an umlaut for the diphthong [aɛ̯] was not right, so I chose to replace that with á, which makes it much easier to remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I decided to move the umlaut from ö to ë and to represent [œ̃] with ĩ. These are debatable choices, but I like how it means I now have only one possible diacritic for each glyph, except for &lt;a&gt; which can have either a tilde to indicate nasalization or an accent for the diphthong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Are there examples of conlangs that are used by applying their structure such as grammar, sentence structure, intonation, means of combining words, etc… with other features of a given language or given member of a class of languages?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has the disadvantage that for understanding one would have to know both the language in question, call this X, and the language it's adapting, call this Y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example and in particular I'm thinking that X could use the alphabet and all the single morpheme nouns and verbs of Y, but replace every other aspect of the language with its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A possible advantage could be in allowing the speaker more reachable access to an unfamiliar linguistic environment, be that a conlang or a natural language, where different modes of thought are the most natural.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It happens with sign languages - often there are two "versions" of a sign language, the first one (less official, natural) is generally used by the community and has its own grammar, the second one (more official, heavily constructed) parallels grammar (syntax) of the corresponding spoken language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g.there is the natural &lt;a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polski_j%C4%99zyk_migowy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Polish Sign Language&lt;/a&gt;, and a rather artificial constructed &lt;a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_j%C4%99zykowo-migowy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Signed Polish&lt;/a&gt;, following closely the syntax of spoken Polish, so somewhat the opposite of the question, a natural language imposing its grammar over the conlang. But it could be said that the signing system (obviously) imposes its own "phonology" over the spoken language.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;What you wrote made me think of a method called &lt;strong&gt;nonviolent communication&lt;/strong&gt;, which argues for expressing yourself very clearly and straightforwardly with regards to your emotions and needs in order to be understood. It recommends phrasing things in such a way as to always be objectively true. That boils down to expressing observations without judgment (e.g. "the sky is blue") and substituting judgmental expressions with expressions of inner emotions, basic needs, and requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's hard to capture the breadth of the theory behind it (I recommend &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWb2B2uPfMo" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested), so I'll give a few examples of what it argues for and against:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The violent way of putting things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"You're an idiot" (judgment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I feel taken advantage of" (not an emotion, but rather a judgment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"You make me angry" (it's one's own mind that creates anger, not a person)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I need you to go away." ("you to go away" is not a basic need; needs in general should not involve specific people)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nonviolent way of putting things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"When you said 'You're an idiot', I felt angry." (expressing an observation and a past emotion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"When I think about you saying 'You're an idiot', I feel angry." (expressing an observation and a current emotion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I feel angry, because I'm needing understanding" (expressing the need behind the emotion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I'm needing peace and quiet. Would you be willing to leave the room?" (expressing a basic need without referencing a specific person)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how can this translate to a constructed language?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get rid of judgmental words.&lt;/strong&gt; Get rid of words like "good", "bad", and "ugly". &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get rid of the word "feel", use verbs for emotions.&lt;/strong&gt; That's to avoid using the word feel in cases where it's not an actual emotion that one's expressing (like feeling "taken advantage of"). The verbs should be intransitive, as to get rid of the idea that something external is responsible for a person's emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a rich vocabulary of emotional words.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/feelings-inventory" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;'s a list to get you started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Center the language around basic needs.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here's a list of needs&lt;/a&gt; for reference. Remember that basic needs never involve specific people, actions or things. (Those should be included in observations and requests.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have most expressions stick to the four components of NVC: observations, emotions, basic needs, and specific requests.&lt;/strong&gt; Sentences might be variations on the form "When I [see/hear/smell/...] [observation], I feel [emotion], because I'm needing [basic needs]. Would you be willing to [request]?" (All components are optional, one can use any subset.) See &lt;a href="https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/aboutnvc/4partprocess.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are various "a priori" constructed languages, though they are not as successful as "a posteriori" languages have been.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I've thought about re-purposing some letters which have vowel-like properties.  For example, the letter /w/ can sometimes be arm-wrestled into a vowel-like state.  Then there's /r/, which is almost like a schwa sometimes, and /n/, which sometimes sounds like... well, like a nasalized null vowel-like thing...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's often not great, but it's okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you mentioned being constrained, but unicode has letters in other alphabets that could help.  Cyrillic for example has letters that might be re-useful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It looks to me that I, you, and he/she are typically not derived from one another.  So Zha "I" might typically be quite different from the word for "You". But beyond that, inflecting these base pronouns is certainly fair game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;English I and you, for example, are unique as far back as we can go (Proto Indo European).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: For the purposes of this question, please do not assume that the &lt;a href="https://wiki.dothraki.org/Main_Page" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Tongues of Ice and Fire Wiki&lt;/a&gt; is correct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;unless it references somewhere else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://wiki.dothraki.org/High_Valyrian_Number" rel="noreferrer"&gt;High Valyrian [grammatical] number&lt;/a&gt; page of the &lt;em&gt;Tongues of Ice and Fire Wiki&lt;/em&gt; contains the statement that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Collectives often acquire a special meaning (e.g. muña "mother" → muñar "parents.") Sometimes this results in them being reanalyzed into entirely new words, with their own plural (e.g. azantys pl. azantyssy "soldier" → azantyr pl. azantyri "army"). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High Valyrian has few irregularities (it is a conlang after all) and generally, when they exist, they're clearly noticed and pointed out. The issue I have is that, while there is a rule where collectives keep the gender of the word they're derived from, that 'rule' doesn't state whether or not completely new words do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give two opposing examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ābrar ['aːbrar] &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;n. 6col.1lun. life. (Relexicalized collective from ābra) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above, ābrar is listed as a lunar&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ('lun.') noun, as it is derived from a lunar noun (ābra). However, if it was reanalysed into a &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; new word, it could potentially instead be listed as an aquatic ('aq.') noun, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;jēdar ['jeːdar] &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;n. 6col.1aq. year (col. of jēda time.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the rules are applied as consistently here as they are in the rest of the language, I'd either expect ābrar to be aquatic or jēdar to be lunar, so &lt;strong&gt;is there some rule that dictates if/when a reanalysed collective keeps/looses the gender of the word it's derived from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 It often has errors and part of the reason for asking this is to find and fix those errors&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2 High Valyrian has 4 genders: lunar, solar, aquatic and terrestrial. Relevant to this question is that lunar nouns generally end in a vowel and aquatic nouns generally end in '-r'&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I apologize for how this question may be perceived. I am casually learning linguistics with no curriculum. I can understand that this question may have many possible answers, but I am not quite sure how else to ask this question. I can also understand if all that may be provided to me is some resource on lists of natural ways languages evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I've come up with two place names, "Yallet" and "Helverly". I'm trying to create enough of a naming language that would allow me to create names that seem to occur naturally in the setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Yallet and Helverly are locations, and so I was wondering if there was a way for the root "let", meaning town, to conceivably evolve to "ly".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can this evolution happen naturally? If so, I would happily read on such transformations. If not, I would be very appreciative of an explanation as to why it would not be a natural evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It is a two-step process, and both steps are very natural and frequently encountered in natural languages. The steps may occur in the other order as well, but the order here deems more common to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of the final stop &lt;em&gt;let&lt;/em&gt; -&gt; &lt;em&gt;le&lt;/em&gt;. This occurs very often, French is a prominent example of this because the final stops are preserved in writing, but lost in pronunciation (with some exceptions when there is a following vowel).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A vowel shift &lt;em&gt;le&lt;/em&gt; -&gt; &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt;, in this case a raising. Again, this step is very natural because /e/ and /i/ are neighbouring vowels in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_diagram" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;vowel diagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two steps use your assumption that &lt;em&gt;let&lt;/em&gt; is the older form that evolves into &lt;em&gt;ly&lt;/em&gt;. A more sophisticated construction could assume a common ancestor for both forms, e.g., &lt;em&gt;lit&lt;/em&gt; that evolves to &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt; by the loss of the final consonant and to &lt;em&gt;let&lt;/em&gt; by lowering the vowel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: As you are generally interested in sound laws, there is a resource named &lt;a href="https://chridd.nfshost.com/diachronica/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Index Diachronica&lt;/a&gt; that lists a lot of sound changes collected from many sources.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In order to see whether &lt;em&gt;-let&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;-ly&lt;/em&gt; are related, there are several options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of them is the 'original' morpheme indicating a settlement, and the other one is derived from it. Maybe the /e/ in /let/ was pronounced [i:] at some point, and then the /t/ dropped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They both have a common ancestor, maybe /ley/. In distinct geographic regions it ended up being pronounced differently, and so it developed into distinct /let/ and /ly/. Or some clerk mis-spelled it /let/ by accident and it stuck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are unrelated, maybe coming from different languages historically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would be most interested in 1 or 2. Language often changes to make things easier to pronounce, so think about how you would pronounce a word in a lazy or sloppy way, slurring the sounds, so that it is still intelligible, but not exactly as it was spelled. And then think how you would write it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, spelling was not normalised, so differences like you describe can easily crop up. It was only (in the West) with the emergence of dictionaries and printing presses that spelling really mattered.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Before I jump headlong into constructing a language, I'd like to do some research and see what others have done before me and learn from their experiences/mistakes.  The keywords I'm currently using are sub-optimal, so I need help tightening them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "communication method" I am thinking of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is purely for reading and writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has no need to be spoken and is thus not based upon letters/phonemes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uses symbols to represent concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each symbol/concept corresponds to something like an English word or sentence (e.g. 'a cat', 'the sound made by flying bees', 'the feeling that results from being beaten by a lesser foe', 'move quickly', 'why?')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;symbols are arranged relative to each other (in 2D space) to communicate more complex concepts and provide context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;symbols are highly domain-specific and exclusive — mining, carpentry, fishing, etc. would have exclusive symbols that only have meaning in their contexts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is not meant to be signed, hummed, whistled, grunted, tapped or transmitted in any other way except for being printed on, and read from, a two-dimensional surface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is not based on any existing language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;would permit deaf people, and people with no common language, to collaborate on very specific tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia defines &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasigraphy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pasigraphy&lt;/a&gt; as 'a writing system where each written symbol represents a concept (rather than a word or sound or series of sounds in a spoken language)' but also defines a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;writing system&lt;/a&gt; as "any conventional method of visually representing verbal communication".  That seems a bit contradictory and confusing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some good/accurate keywords that describe this 'thing' I am trying to develop?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;Before I jump headlong into constructing a language, I'd like to do some research and see what others have done before me and learn from their experiences/mistakes.  The keywords I'm currently using are sub-optimal, so I need help tightening them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "communication method" I am thinking of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is purely for reading and writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has no need to be spoken and is thus not based upon letters/phonemes&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I think you're overthinking this a little. While what you're considering is unusual, I can't see any reason why it wouldn't just be a written language in a logographic script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is purely for reading and writing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has no need to be spoken and is thus not based upon letters/phonemes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is not meant to be signed, hummed, whistled, grunted, tapped or transmitted in any other way except for being printed on, and read from, a two-dimensional surface&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has no need to be, sure. But if humans or human-like beings are there they would most likely develop an oral way of "reading" it eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;uses symbols to represent concepts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;each symbol/concept corresponds to something like an English word or sentence (e.g. 'a cat', 'the sound made by flying bees', 'the feeling that results from being beaten by a lesser foe', 'move quickly', 'why?')&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;symbols are highly domain-specific and exclusive — mining, carpentry, fishing, etc. would have exclusive symbols that only have meaning in their contexts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a logographic writing system. Now it's not clear if the symbols for phrases are made up of component symbols for the things they represent or are unique singular symbols. Building symbols from other symbols would make sense, otherwise the number of symbols would grow exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;symbols are arranged relative to each other (in 2D space) to communicate more complex concepts and provide context&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is on the surface the biggest difference between your proposal and human languages, which for both spoken and written language are linear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However consider that some branches of linguistics believe that all language is representable by binary trees alone. If your language has a syntax (and if it doesn't it really couldn't be considered language) then we'd expect that it would be possible to develop a tree-based representation of it, perhaps using multiple levels of deep structure below the surface. And a non-binary tree could be converted to a binary tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just spent some time looking at 2D languages, both conlangs and programming languages, and all the ones I found consisted of linear paths to follow or a tree structure. Conlangger Sai &lt;a href="https://s.ai/essays/nlf2dws" rel="noreferrer"&gt;has explained their ideas for a non-linear fully 2D writing system&lt;/a&gt;, but they don't give an example of such a writing system. But they do say that their version of non-linearity is distinguished from linear design systems only by inelegance or convolution. I'd take this to mean that actually it is serialisable (and therefore could in theory be spoken) if not by humans then by some being of great intelligence. The essay is worth reading anyway if this topic continues to interest you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In fact, I believe I can say that it is not possible, short of crippled or very simple specialty cases, to directly convert a linear writing to a non-linear one without either loosing a lot of meaning (NLàL), being extremely inelegant by virtue of failing to take advantage of better design (LàNL), or becoming functionally incomprehensible (e.g. the list format in which an Nth-degree array is stored in the C programming language).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;So, what is non-linearity?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;At its core, NL has to do with how concepts are arranged, both on physical paper and in their more abstract form. A NL system is a multigraph; its components are, or can be, extremely interconnected. There is no single traversal method, though there may be some conventional ones. There may not be a ‘traversal’ method at all, as such;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Latino sine flexione is a variant of Latin created by Peano in 1903. As far as I know it was used in scientific literature but since forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/latinosineflexio/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; and a few discussions on &lt;a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/26079920/What-about-Latino-Sine-Flexione-aka-Peano%E2%80%99s-Interlingua" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt; but not a single speaker.
A quite complete grammar can be found &lt;a href="http://mi.anihost.ru/Peano/lsf.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this wonderful project dead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: I posted the same question &lt;a href="https://latin.stackexchange.com/questions/10614/is-latino-sine-flexione-dead"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and was suggested to "address a different community".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know whether there is a functional speech community for this language left.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There is such a &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; written language. Chinese. One reason that Chinese is not based on pronunciation is that there are a lot of local dialects that sounds very different from the official mandarin. The Chinese characters are pronounced in a certain way in &lt;strong&gt;mandardin&lt;/strong&gt; but totally different in say &lt;strong&gt;cantonese&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex characters are built from smaller radicals, and make use of 2d arrangements. (Forest = three tree radicals spread out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written Chinese fulfills basically all your points, except perhaps that it is based on an existing language (mandardin, but perhaps one might say that mandarin is based on the written language, or that these co-evolved).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you are looking for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blissymbols" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blissymbols&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. According to Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Blissymbols or Blissymbolics was conceived as an ideographic writing system called Semantography consisting of several hundred basic symbols, each representing a concept, which can be composed together to generate new symbols that represent new concepts. Blissymbols differ from most of the world's major writing systems in that the characters do not correspond at all to the sounds of any spoken language. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Blissymbols was invented by Charles K. Bliss (1897–1985) ... [who] wanted to create an easy-to-learn international auxiliary language to allow communication between different linguistic communities. He was inspired by Chinese characters, with which he became familiar at Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;To add a completely different answer, which certainly is constructed, but might not really be classified as a language as such, but it still conveys meaning in a non-verbal fashion: &lt;em&gt;formulas in mathematics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equations, and logical statements can be conveyed in this fashion. 
I think for example proofs in Euclidean geometry can be presented entirely without English words, and be perfectly understandable by a mathematician. Proofs are "pictorial" (using symbols for rather abstract concepts), and the figures used to present related ideas are 2-dimensional.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In Dovahzul, you can show possession by using &lt;code&gt;se&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ro&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;dro&lt;/code&gt;. However, the pronouns already have possessive versions of themselves (e.g. &lt;code&gt;You&lt;/code&gt; goes to &lt;code&gt;Your&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would something like &lt;code&gt;hisedok&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;hi do dok&lt;/code&gt; work instead of &lt;code&gt;hin dok&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In English &lt;code&gt;You's&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;Your&lt;/code&gt; wouldn't be grammatically correct, and Dovahzul is remarkably similar to English, but there may be an exception to this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a lot to say on this subject, as I've been working on such a project for 30 years.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terms vary, but "pasigraphy" is one of the terms, as you mentioned.  "Ideographic writing" or "ideography" is another term; and "realle carracter" (various spellings) is a 1600's term.  LaVan Martineau claimed that Native American rock-writing was a non-sound-based writing; he used the term "pictography" for this.  And don't forget "hieroglyphic writing".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was initially inspired by Francis Lodwick's (various spellings) &lt;em&gt;A Common Writing...&lt;/em&gt;" of 1647.  Blissymbols (mentioned above) is one of the more fleshed-out projects; but there are others.  John Wilkins' &lt;em&gt;Essay Towards a Real Character...&lt;/em&gt; was a classificatory system, similar to the Dewey Decimal System, with abstract symbols assigned to the classifiers.  Other projects: Pictopen by Juan Garay, Locos by Yukio Ota, Unideo by Eric Cattelain, Book from the Ground by Bing Xu, IRC (International Realle Carracter) by me.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a very simple question regarding a small problem I cannot find a single satisfying answer to. I am trying to create a country with a prominent Slavic culture. In my story, an alien world has been colonized by the nations of Earth. Respectively, each name their lands and territories how they see fit and in their own language. As for this country, it was colonized by the Slavic nations and is rightly given a Slavic sounding name. In fact, the entire continent it exists on shares the same name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, my problem rests in the fact that I'm American and know little Russian except simple greetings. I want to create a genuine sounding Slavic name for the land but do not know where to start. Honestly, I do not understand the Slavic tongues' structures and vocabularies. I'm not entirely sure how to phrase this question so I'll be blunt. Simply, I want to know how to create a genuine sounding Slavic place name. Particularly, I want a name that describes the land itself (just as Belarus means "White Russia") or named after an important figure (just like how the U.S. state Pennsylvania is named after William Penn).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the English Wikipedia does not have an article on Slavic toponymy yet, the best attempt I am able to find is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_placename_etymology" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Bulgarian placename etymology&lt;/a&gt; giving at least some hints. You can find interesting Slavic roots to play with in the article on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_names" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Slavic given names&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are some Slavic based conlangs out there, you can honour one of them by employing it in your fictional world, to drop just names &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovio" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Slovio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://steen.free.fr/interslavic" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Interslavic&lt;/a&gt;, see also &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Slavic_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pan-Slavic language&lt;/a&gt; for an overview.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Based off the audio file from &lt;a href="https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/tokipona.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;, and the audio files from &lt;a href="https://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/tokipona.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;, we can infer that Toki Pona is a "fast" language. It uses 6 - 8 syllables / second, except with punctuation, where you delay for the same time as English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Youtube videos stick to the contrary, but their speed is slow to make it easier for nonexperienced Toki Pona speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Please bear with me as I elaborate. 
I'm looking to create a language for humanoids that live in a set of cave systems and tunnels. While their language may have been 'born' on the surface, they have moved under the ground ages ago. The Ecosystem under the ground is very hostile, and so they had to adapt their language to carry less when spoken. 
For this purpose, I'm trying to find out which of the known vocal sounds would be more prevalent in such a language.
(I am a true novice in the field, mind you, so I'm, reading several language construction guides to help in this endeavor)
So, what I'm asking, essentially, is which of the vocal sounds (labial, dental, palatal etc etc) would echo more, and which would echo less. I've searched in vain for an answer, and I don't have a convenient cave to test that in.
Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It would probably be a question of volume and frequency pattern. Loud sounds would travel further (and thus have more potential for echo). I would like to stress that I too have no cave to try this out, so there is a certain speculative aspect to this answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, avoid vowels (obviously), and voiced sounds (prefer /p/, /t/, /k/, /f/, /s/ over /b/, /d/, /g/, /v/, /z/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, such a language would be pretty hard to use, so you'd need to compromise. Assuming low frequency sounds have less energy, the vowels /u/ and /o/ might be suitable, and perhaps the schwa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plosives (/p/, /b/, /t/) feature a burst as the air is released, which might also not work well, so you're probably better off using fricatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves you with voiceless fricatives: /f/, /th/, /s/, /S/, /h/. Though voiced, nasals might also be suitable, as the mouth is closed during the articulation and thus it is possible to pronounce them without releasing too much acoustic energy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Ursula K Le Guin's Earthsea stories contain vocabulary and utterances from three invented languages. The first step to fleshing these out into fully developed conlangs would be to list all the examples from the books and make some notes on any regularities or inconsistencies. Has anyone done this and put it up online?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;For the toki pona language there is a &lt;a href="http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/hieroglyphs.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;writing system&lt;/a&gt; where each word is replaced by a single logogram or hieroglyph. There is also a &lt;a href="http://sitelen-pona.herokuapp.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;web-based converter&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to enter a text in toki pona and converts it into a single PNG rendering in said hieroglyphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was wondering if there was a way to directly produce texts in hieroglyphs, either as a font, or as a set of individual image files (ie one per word/hieroglyph), which could be used to render texts on webpages etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was wondering if there was a way to directly produce texts in hieroglyphs, either as a font, or as a set of individual image files (ie one per word/hieroglyph), which could be used to render texts on webpages etc.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A conlang I am working on contains the nasal syllabic consonants [m̩] and [n̩] fairly frequently.  It seems like it would be a natural step for the language to develop what I would call a voiced velopharyngeal stop occurring before those syllabic consonants are used some of the time, to add emphasis.  This stop is formed by stopping air from flowing into the nasal cavity with the velum while the mouth is in position to form the following consonant, and then releasing it into the nasal cavity.  Think of it as trying to make a “g” sound through your nose only.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex:  [ĩɲ'tⁿn̩] =&gt; [ĩɲ't̚?ⁿn̩], where the ? represents the consonant in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;:  This is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a glottal stop, though that sound can occur as well in this language.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to transcribe the language with the IPA since it helps specify pronunciation of the weird vocabulary of sounds, but I cannot find a symbol in the IPA that represents this sound, even though it seems to me fairly plausible for a language of this type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest I have found is the symbol for a velopharyngeal fricative [ʩ] in extensions to the IPA.  However this still is clearly distinct from the sound I am describing.  Additionally, it appears to only occur as a speech defect and never as a proper consonant in a language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the best way to transcribe this specific sound using the IPA?&lt;/strong&gt;  Is there an allotted symbol that I just could not find?  What would be the best way to go about phonetically transcribing the sound if there is no exact symbol in the IPA?  Is there a better approximation than [ʩ]?  Additionally, what about the unvoiced counterpart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for any mistakes in my use of the IPA, I am still learning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;If I were to translate, I'd say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The intellect of (the strength of Libya) the many head advisers of the second director of Atlantis...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"pona sona" - goodness of knowledge (intellect/sensibleness), good knowledge-wise (the intellectually adept) 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;jan ni li pona sona - this person is intellectually adept (brilliant / intellectual)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"wawa pi ma Lipija" - power/strength of Libya&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"poka toki lawa mute" - many head/main talking sides/companions (the many head advisers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"jan lawa nanpa tu" - second head person (second director/ruler/president)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some issues I have with the phrase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incomplete&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phrase doesn't have a "li" phrase, or verb phrase, as was mentioned, making it, as far as sentences go, incomplete, which doesn't give much any clues for context. Personally, I generally parse sentences like this as a reduced form of "ni li ...", but that's also given conversational context (really "&lt;em&gt;conversational subject&lt;/em&gt; li...").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;jan Sanato: "jan o! jan sina li kama anu seme? ike a!"&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;jan Mikanle: "o awen! o!... a, kama!"&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Johnatho: "hey! Is your guy coming or what? He's terrible, eh!"&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mickanley: "Just wait!... oh look, here he comes!"&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, either way, I can't say if there is any official basis for such a parsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addressing other suggestions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was suggested that the parenthesis are to ensure the "wawa pi ma Lipija" isn't mis-parsed separately, however, I don't think this is the case for two reasons: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unconventional&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have never come across round brackets being used in this manner in toki pona, and it doesn't seem likely since, it would be too confused with the more standard use of round brackets (holding a phrase that isn't part of the sentence, but clarifies it in some way). More likely if this were the case, square brackets or commas would be employed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unnecessary&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brackets wouldn't be needed for this purpose since one could not parse "pi wawa" seperately from the subsequent "pi ma Lipija". The reason for this is that "pi" cannot be followed by a lone word, in this case "wawa".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[ pona sona pi [ wawa pi [ma Lipija ] ] ] - The intellect of the power of Libya&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[ [ pona sona wawa ] pi [ ma Lipija ] ] - The strong intellect of Libya&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To say "Libya's &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; of/concerning strength", it would likely be structured "pona sona pi ma Lipija pi ijo wawa" or "pona sona pi ma Lipija pi wawa ijo", the second being a bit more on the mark ("concerning strong things" vs. "concerning the strength of things"). Although we translate "pi" as "of", "pi wawa" cannot be used to mean "of strength", and would rather be grammatically incorrect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous translation translates "pona sona" as "the good folklore" and "pi poka" as "near".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like jan Kipo, I can't quite see where "good folklore" came from, given the basic definition of the words as well as their structure in the sentence, but I can't say if it would really be accepted I guess (*tilts head 90°). For "good folklore", I'd probably use something along the lines of "sona kulupu pona", or perhaps even "sona mama pona".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As for "pi poka", it is conventional to translate it to "near", though, I would shy away from that translation in favor of "of a side(noun)" since I would more use "pi poka pi" for near, though I'm again unsure if it'd be acceptable. If so, in this case though, it's a bit 50/50, since there's no other head noun besides "poka" to clarify. If you wanted "side person (adviser/companion)", you'd more likely say "jan poka".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Hangul&lt;/a&gt; is a beautiful constructed script, used to write the natural languages of Korean, Jeju, Hokkien, and Cia-Cia, perhaps others.  The shape of the letters mimic the shape of the mouth, and a letter for a voiceless consonant is directly related to the letter for its voiced counterpart.  Personally, I think it's brilliant and should be adopted worldwide, perhaps with some additions to consider sounds that do not exist in Korean (by far the most dominant language using it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea of constructed international auxiliary languages is that those languages should have a simple and logical grammar to be easy to learn.  But it appears most of those languages are still written with the Latin alphabet, which doesn't have much or any connection between the look of a letter and its pronunciation — this still needs to be learned by heart.  A learner cannot derive the pronunciation of a previously unknown letter from its shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have there been any designs of constructed languages, aiming to be international auxiliary languages (thus not counting fictional alien/fantasy languages), which from the start had a dedicated constructed script designed to be as simple as possible, yet universally applicable?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;To capture all of physics, perhaps "sona pi pali ijo" or simply "sona pali" (a knowledge of action). I prefer the former, since persons may tend to think only of human action with the latter, which may translate to "behavioral science", whereas the former is a bit more precise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physics is a general field that focuses on the behavior of things in our universe, finding explanations for their actions and the interactions that occur between things. The term is also a little more precise than "sona ijo", since Physics doesn't (correct me if I'm wrong) really answer questions like 'what structure a thing has', but would rather more specifically answer 'how did the thing's structure come to be'.    &lt;/p&gt;

The term is also a little more precise than "sona ijo", since Physics doesn't (correct me if I'm wrong) really answer questions like 'what structure a thing has', but would rather more specifically answer 'how did the thing's structure come to be'.    &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;(I do think this would be more appropriate as a comment somewhere, but sigh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the others have pointed out, the primary reason for a rarity of noun phrases beyond three words is due to an increasing difficulty to understand the phrase with each added modifier, however it is my hypothesis at least that this may only truly apply to written communication as opposed to verbal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I have little experience verbally communicating with toki pona (I can't find much anyone who wants to learn in my vicinity TT^TT), it isn't hard to imagine that the aid of body language, and vocalization, perhaps among other things, could make longer strings possible, without being too difficult to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing beyond that is how reasonable the phrase is. I think in jan Masiju's example, whether using verbal or written communication, my brain would always break at "waso". &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;What I think you meant to ask is to create a stop consonant by stopping air flowing through the nasal cavity while the mouth is open, then releasing it only through the nose while the mouth is closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that having no airstream block in the mouth can mean one of two things: producing an oral vowel, such as /a/, or making no sound at all. There isn't a plosive-like sound for stopping air flowing through the nose, as there is with the mouth (in multiple places). The way you can test this is by producing a sound like /aãaãaãa/, in which you are repeatedly stopping the nasal airflow, and yet the vowel sound remains continuous because there is no stop of air in the mouth. So a stop created solely by blocking the nasal passage is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example you give for this sound is [ĩɲ't̚?ⁿn̩], where the [?] is supposed to represent the unknown sound. This has a [t̚] with the diacritic for no release after the consonant, and a nasal release [ⁿ] after it. However, there can't possibly be anything between [t̚] and [ⁿ]. The [t̚] means that when the consonant ends, you are still blocking both oral and nasal airflow, and the [ⁿ] means that you are releasing nasal airflow while keeping oral airflow closed. There is no articulation possible in between these: if there were an oral release, the diacritic on [t̚] would have no meaning, and there could no longer be a nasal release [ⁿ] after it. The only possibility is to add another consonant, or extend the [t] as a long consonant [tː], which continues to block all airflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through your definition, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_release" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;nasal release&lt;/a&gt; seems to fit (another possibility that fits just as well is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-stopped_consonant" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pre-stopped nasal&lt;/a&gt;, if the nasal consonant is supposed to be more prominent than the stop):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This stop is formed by stopping air from flowing into the nasal cavity with the velum &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stopping airflow is a property of a stop consonant. A stop consonant stops the airflow in the mouth as well as the airflow in the nasal cavity. (Stopping only the airflow in the nasal cavity is impossible here, as explained above.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;while the mouth is in position to form the following consonant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous articulation is possible, but it depends on what the following consonant is. If the following consonant is in the same place of articulation, that means there's no change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;and then releasing it into the nasal cavity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Releasing the stop only in the nasal cavity means producing a nasal sound. Nasal release (and nasals in general) would continue to block the airflow in the mouth, but allow it to pass through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I wonder how is it possible to construct a language based on the existing languages. There are Indo-European, Altaic, Semitic, and a small portion of Dravidian and Caucasic languages in my country, and I am thinking of a constructed language based on all of these languages.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There should be no problem in doing so -- just mix and match features from the various source languages. A precedent for this for example is English:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the syntax/grammar is mainly Germanic, including many function words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the vocabulary is mixed (Latin, Norse, Anglo-Saxon, Norman French, Indian, ...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would choose on language as the "base" (in the English case it's Old English/Anglo-Saxon), and then modify it by replacing/adding some of the vocabulary from the different languages. Also, some grammatical features (morphological endings etc) could be mixed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do it iteratively (ie revising the language multiple times, simulating contact between the current version and another influencing language), you can also take into account other types of changes, such as dropping endings which are harder to pronounce, or making higher frequent words shorter and less regular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you do exactly is up to you, but there shouldn't be any problem from a linguistic point of view. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Possible? Definitely yes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to give you some more hints on how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Base on common features:&lt;/em&gt; When choosing the sounds for your conlang, prefer those sounds that have a broad coverage in your language base, and avoid those the are specific to only one of them. Do the same for syllable structure, look what consonants can cluster with each other in a lot of your base languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select common words:&lt;/em&gt; Look what words already have crossed the language boundaries and appear as loan words in other languages. These words are hot candidates for inclusion in your conlang. Note also that the process of loaning words tends to result in phonological and morphological simplifications, consider adopting these simplifications as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morphology:&lt;/em&gt; Look for common categories expressed by morphology in the base languages, and use a simplified system of them. While Arabic morphology (inflectional and derivational) is elegant and impressive, it does not carry over to languages with a different structure (no triconsonantal roots) well. But you still can borrow some elements from it (e.g., prefixes and suffixes). Make sure to create at least some derivational morphology, it will simplify the language and the process of creating the vocab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Syntax:&lt;/em&gt; Check out the basic word order and the way how to form relative clauses and subordinate clauses in your base language, and create a syntax from this information. Also look for &lt;em&gt;word order&lt;/em&gt; phenomena (adjectives before or after the noun, prepositions or postpositions, genitives before or after the noun) and decide how to do them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonority_hierarchy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sonority&lt;/a&gt; refers to the amplitude of the sound signal; ie the louder a sound is, the higher it ranks. Vowels are loudest, as they are voiced and generally less constricted than most consonants. Within the vowels, the open ones (eg /a/),  are louder than the closed ones (/i/, /u/). Then laterals, nasals, fricatives, and finally plosives. Within each of these groups (where applicable) the voiced variant is higher than the voiceless one (eg /g/ &gt; /k/, and /d/ &gt; /t/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matches the ranking in your image, so I would say it is correct.&lt;/p&gt;

While this language doesn't apply exactly to your question, you seem to be interested in NON-Latin based character IAL's.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Calling &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;em&gt;particle&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;predicate marker&lt;/em&gt; is correct and not misleading. A Toki Pona clause can have more than one predicate. &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; never marks a non-predicate. It also appears on every predicate except when that predicate &lt;em&gt;is the first one in the clause and the subject is&lt;/em&gt; exactly &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;mi&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;/em&gt; exactly &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;sina&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (101) or when preceded by the vocative/imperative particle &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt; (102).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a good way to analyze this would be to say that every indicative predicate obligatorily has a predicate marker, but sometimes it's null.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mi  moku  li   pakala. (101)
I   food  LI  mistake.
I eat and destroy.

o   lukin     e    ni. (102)
IMP   see  DObj  that.
watch this.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a fragment of (my best guess of) the Toki Pona grammar. I haven't seen any examples of stacking imperative phrases, so I don't know whether &lt;em&gt;look and say&lt;/em&gt; would be &lt;code&gt;o lukin li toki&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;o lukin o toki&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in Toki Pona verb phrases and noun phrases are different syntactically. For instance, &lt;code&gt;*sina moku e soweli ala soweli.&lt;/code&gt; cannot be used to mean &lt;em&gt;are you a vegetarian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;LI        := 0 | "li"
PredInd   := LI VP {PP} | LI NP
ClauseInd := NP [PredInd]
PredImp   := "o" VP {PP} | "o" NP
ClauseImp := NP PredImp | PredImp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not thrilled with this analysis because of the asymmetry between indicative and imperative clauses. Unifying the clause types, however, would predict that &lt;code&gt;*li moku.&lt;/code&gt; is valid. As far as I can tell, Toki Pona does not permit null subjects in indicative clauses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of two potential alternative analyses for &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt;: A) it's a pronoun (like in Example 4 Longgu &lt;a href="https://wals.info/chapter/101" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;on this WALS article&lt;/a&gt; or B) it's a preposition.  I'll try to show that both of those analyses lead to bad predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A) &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; as pronoun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This falls apart for a couple of reasons. It predicts that &lt;code&gt;mi moku li pakala&lt;/code&gt; would be invalid and that the correct form would be &lt;code&gt;mi moku mi pakala&lt;/code&gt;. In reality, both forms are fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; as a pronoun also predicts that &lt;code&gt;*li moku&lt;/code&gt; would be valid since it would contain an explicit subject under that analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;code&gt;*mi moku li.&lt;/code&gt; cannot be used to mean &lt;em&gt;I eat it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B) &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; as preposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; were a preposition, (103) and (104) would both be valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mi pakala e moku. (103)
I ruin the food.

*Mi e moku li pakala. (104)
*I ruin the food.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; were a preposition, the following would be invalid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ona mute li toki ala toki? (105)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I think you can express something like this as (101). If we imagine a speaker addicted to using their smartphone, they might say something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mi  wile ike    e  ilo  toki. (101)
1sg want bad D.O. tool speak
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;em&gt;to want badly&lt;/em&gt; in English would map to &lt;code&gt;wile mute&lt;/code&gt;, since you're talking about extent rather than making a value judgment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a value judgment and describing wanting something as egodystonic are not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same thing, but they are similar, at least when talking about oneself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm getting started with creating a language and I run into trouble when I started using rules I devised for protolanguage (e.g. only open syllables).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I run into trouble when I tried to apply it to string [epse] which I'd syllabilized as [ep.se] rather than [e.pse]. I'm assuming I did something wrong with sonority hierarchy but I failed to find resources about what exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; I would prefer generic rules for syllabication but for the Y problem - the rules I set so far is (C)CV syllable where:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are two consonants exactly one of them is a fricative (s, x or ʂ)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fricative must follow plosives, nasals and trills but must precede lateral approximants (l)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;You are the conlang designer, and you are in power to decide that &lt;em&gt;epse&lt;/em&gt; is syllabified as &lt;em&gt;e.pse&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;by design of the language&lt;/strong&gt;. This is not as unnatural as it might look at first sight for a native speaker of English, in Classical Greek, the letter Ψ (psi) can occur word-initially and is always considered a unit for syllabification.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm interested in knowing what living languages Valyrian from &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; resembles the most in its &lt;strong&gt;grammar&lt;/strong&gt; and/or &lt;strong&gt;vocabulary&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've gathered here some very basic examples of what kind of similarities I would like to know of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History/Culture&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To the layman the history of the language group seems to resemble that or &lt;em&gt;latin&lt;/em&gt; (and maybe &lt;em&gt;arabic&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vocabulary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I have understood correctly the Valyrian vocabulary is formed so that it shouldn't sound like any living language so probably there's not much similarities there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grammar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems to contain many word inflections which would mean it bears more similarity to &lt;em&gt;Latin&lt;/em&gt; than for example &lt;em&gt;English&lt;/em&gt;, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has four grammatical genders and here the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valyrian_languages" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; mentions some kind of similarity to &lt;em&gt;Bantu languages&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any other aspects of Valyrian containing significant similarities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm aware that David J. Peterson, the creator of the language for the series didn't base Valyrian on any existing language. Yet it does seem to resemble in many aspects some languages much more (Latin, also Lithuanian comes to mind) than others (Chinese). It might not be a complete language but it has hundreds of words and what seems to be a well-thought-out grammar (see the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valyrian_languages" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;) so it should be possible to compare linguistic similarities.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I think as a general rule, a syllable comprises some combination of the following kinds of one or more of the sound types of your language:  vowel, liquid, consonant.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've decided on (C)CV.  And if there are two C then one must be a sibilant and the sibilant must follow a stop. So you can have syllables like &lt;em&gt;sa&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ta&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tsa&lt;/em&gt;  but apparently not &lt;em&gt;sta&lt;/em&gt;.  You might then have a words like &lt;em&gt;tasa&lt;/em&gt; &amp; &lt;em&gt;satsa&lt;/em&gt; &amp; &lt;em&gt;tsatsa&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In English, we'd probably break that into SAT-SA.  Your language will likely differ, because everyone knows that a syllable can't end with a consonant!  So, they'd much more likely break the word thus: SA-TSA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue that what little you've described of your language and its rules speaks in favour of E-PSE rather than EP-SE.  The only thing you "did wrong" was to apply the English rule rather than the rules that apply to your invented language! The second thing you did wrong was to second guess yourself based on the English rule!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It is probably impossible to say which language resembles Valyrian most, lacking a metric for similarity. But there are clearly identifyable influences of other languages, both constructed and natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the catch phrase &lt;em&gt;valar morghulis&lt;/em&gt; from GRRM: It just sounds like Tolkien's Elvish languages, with &lt;em&gt;valar&lt;/em&gt; being a word from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Quenya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;morghul&lt;/em&gt; a word from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sindarin&lt;/a&gt;. Both Quenya and Sindarin have &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/1/were-tolkiens-elvish-languages-based-on-known-natural-languages"&gt;well-known influences from natural languages&lt;/a&gt;: Finnish for Quenya and Welsh for Sindarin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at High Valyrian, some Finnish feeling is still retained in the language: There is a distinction between long and short consonants as well as vowels, the case endings still have some Finnish feel (and a Latin feel, too, especially the vowel alternations), the phonotactics resemble Finnish. It is further away from Finnish than Quenya in its phonology contrasting voiced and voiceless stops and featuring the sound /q/. There is little Welsh in High Valyrian left, maybe the frequency of &lt;a href="http://www.babynamewizard.com/archives/2011/9/the-women-of-fantasy-context-free-femininity-part-2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;"the defining fantasy vowel" ae&lt;/a&gt; (Laura Wattenberg) can be traced to Welsh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 8-case system may be insprired by Languages like Russian or Sanskrit, with the commitative case being typologically rare, but occurring in Finnish again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four noun classes are a creative invention (but not far of, as natural language, especially Native American languages, are concerned) and I see no closer resemblence to Bantu languages (they have a lot of noun classes, but the noun classes are marked by overt prefixes that are also used as agreement markers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The syntax with head-final relative clauses may be inspired by languages like Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. While Peterson has stated some &lt;a href="http://dothraki.conlang.org/official-hbo-press-release/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;linguistic influences for the Dothraki language&lt;/a&gt;, I have not found a similar quote for Valyrian. So all the observations above are mine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Currently I have a very simple proto-language which I'm trying to evolve. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;slishi  hu      ho    shofli  shofli pfufi   tushi
repair  person  tool  fish.V  fish.V succeed cause
Person repairs fish net to have abundant catch.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this seems to be confusing and unwieldy, so I'm assuming that native speakers would feel the same and would attempt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To change &lt;em&gt;tushi&lt;/em&gt; into something similar to 'so that' combining two sentences where one causes another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To change &lt;em&gt;pfufi&lt;/em&gt; into an adverb - &lt;em&gt;successfully&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something like (for example):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;slishi hu      ho    shofli tushu   shofli  nshi     pfufe         he
repair person  tool  fish.V so.that fish.V  AUX.FUT  successfully  3.PRO
Person repairs fish net so that he will have an aboundant catch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;em&gt;tushi&lt;/em&gt; (to cause) has been changed into &lt;em&gt;tushu&lt;/em&gt; (so that) to make a conjunction and &lt;em&gt;pfufi&lt;/em&gt; (to succeed) into &lt;em&gt;pfufe&lt;/em&gt; (successfully) to make an adverb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I'm not sure what a natural way of doing this would be. Most guides for conlangs suggest to apply phonological evolution rules universally, so I'm not sure if it is natural to diverge [-i] into [-ɨ/e] and then [-u/e] to derive an adverb/preposition/conjunction and suggest to evolve the adverbs from nouns or verbs, but they don't provide guides for creating a derivation systems (that I found).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this helps, the language later/earlier evolves tenses by adding the pronouns - ignoring other changes that happened in between:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;slishi-he  hu     ho   shofli  tushu   shofli nshi    pfufe         he
repair-1   person tool fish.V  so.that fish.V AUX.FUT successfully  3.PRO
Person repairs fish net so that he will have an aboundant catch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;This is more a lengthy comment on your question than a real answer, but comment space is restricted ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are undertaking a very difficult task by setting a starting point and an end point and asking for natural development between the two. This is difficult even when it is known that such a natural development exists because the two languages are attested natural languages and not constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know sound laws really well, and also the process of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammaticalization" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;grammaticalization&lt;/a&gt; is fairly well understood. The evolution of different basic word orders is still under research, we know that it has happened but how exactly it happened, is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that your are needing some grammaticalisation to get from the verb &lt;em&gt;pfufi&lt;/em&gt; to the adverb &lt;em&gt;pfufe&lt;/em&gt;. Here's a suggestion: Add a particle &lt;em&gt;ye&lt;/em&gt; meaning roughly "like" to your proto-language, and the phrase &lt;em&gt;pfufi ye&lt;/em&gt; will fill the role of an adverb. It is easy to conceive, that &lt;em&gt;pfufi ye&lt;/em&gt; evolves to &lt;em&gt;pfufe&lt;/em&gt; by just dropping one syllable (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(phonology)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;syncope&lt;/a&gt;). To make &lt;em&gt;tushu&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;tushi&lt;/em&gt; a particle like &lt;em&gt;vu&lt;/em&gt; might be applicable, but I have some difficulties to define its original meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that language change is easier &lt;a href="https://writing.stackexchange.com/questions/21316/is-there-a-hybrid-novel-writing-method-that-incorporates-both-pantsing-and-plo"&gt;to "grow" than to "plot"&lt;/a&gt;, i.e., it is easier to just apply changes to a proto-language and watch where they lead to than to interpolate between two stages of a language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you can invoke language contact to achieve a particular change in your language evolution, as kind of last resort to save the plot. Just don't overuse this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I have to vote for poka open for left, &amp; poka pini for right. They don't cause any more problem than anything else. poka wawa is a bad idea right-handed people would assume that meant right, but that makes it confusing for left-handed people. Because the sun rises (open) in the East &amp; sets (pini) in the West, we could make "poka suno" East &amp; "poka pimeja" West. "poka kon" could be North, &amp; "poka ma" could be South.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Concerning compound subjects and such, I'm not exactly sure how lists of nouns work exactly, especially with three or more items. How would "bears and metal drums" be distinguished from "bears, metal, and drums"? Wouldn't both be &lt;code&gt;mIl'oDmey baS 'Inmey je&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Klingon Dictionary&lt;/em&gt; says that &lt;code&gt;je&lt;/code&gt; follows two or more nouns, so I wouldn't think you use multiple, and I've only seen commas used in dependent clauses. Is there a way to clarify your meaning?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Say for instance I want to say something like, "I'm looking for bears and the lost sheep." I would think that would be to use the genitive case, making something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mIl'oDmey chIlpu'ghach       DI'raqmey   je  vInejtaH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;bear-&lt;pl&gt; lose-&lt;perf&gt;-&lt;nom&gt;  sheep-&lt;pl&gt;  too &lt;I-them&gt;-look for-&lt;continuous&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that looks kind of odd, and I've heard that using the nominalizer suffix "-ghach" is often discouraged, and should replaced by using sentences as objects if possible. Would &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mIl'oDmey DI'raqmey   'e'  chIlpu'     je  vInejtaH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;bear-&lt;pl&gt; sheep-&lt;pl&gt;  that lose-&lt;perf&gt; and &lt;I-them&gt;-look for-&lt;continuous&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;work and make more sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, how would "I can bear the loss of sheep." be translated? My first guess would be to just reverse the noun-noun-construction so that "DI'raqmey" is the genitive noun:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;DI'raqmey   chIlpu'ghach      vISIQlaH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;sheep-&lt;pl&gt;  lose-&lt;perf&gt;-&lt;nom&gt; &lt;I-it&gt;-endure/bear-&lt;ability&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would some sort of subclause make more sense here too? Just the same one?:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;DI'raqmey    'e'  chIlpu'     vISIQlaH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I think it depends on the context. If it is "I can see bears and metal drums", then you would have to repeat the subject and verb, effectively saying "I can see bears and I can see metal drums".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per The Klingon Dictionary (6.2, &lt;em&gt;Complex Sentences&lt;/em&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the subject of both the joined sentences is the same, the English translation may be reduced to a less choppy form, but Klingon does not allow this shortening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are just talking about lists of items without having a complex sentence, then I would think this sentence from 5.3 (&lt;em&gt;Conjunctions&lt;/em&gt;) applies (even though it is about the post-verbal meaning of &lt;em&gt;je&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As in English, the meaning of such sentences is ambiguous: [..] The exact meaning is determined by context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are bears and metal drums, then presumably you're not talking about bears, metal, and drums. An oft-quoted example where there is an ambiguity in English is &lt;em&gt;I am dedicating this work to my parents, the Queen of England and the Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;/em&gt;. Without a comma before &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;, the list could be mistaken for an apposition. Obviously, the context makes this interpretation highly unlikely!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that language is rarely unambiguous and independent of context; any attempts to avoid this make it very unwieldy. Which is why legal language is typically so hard to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I would translate it as &lt;em&gt;I am looking for bears and I am looking for the sheep that are lost.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; I don't know the word for &lt;em&gt;sheep&lt;/em&gt;, so I assume from your question that it's &lt;strong&gt;DI'raq&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See: Klingon Dictionary 6.2 (&lt;em&gt;Complex Sentences&lt;/em&gt;) and 6.2.3 (&lt;em&gt;Relative Clauses&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your second sentence, &lt;em&gt;I can bear the loss of sheep.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; I would opt for a subordinate clause, &lt;em&gt;If I lose sheep, I can bear it.&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In my world, I have a race of humanoids who speak a language called &lt;em&gt;Gé̃kt&lt;/em&gt;, which is derived from various Eastern Iranian languages such as Khotanese, Ossetian, Yaghnobi and Bactrian with a dash of Persian (a Western Iranian language) thrown in for good measure. However, these humanoids lack lips and I have no idea how this traits would affect their speech. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, here are Gé̃kt's constants and vowels. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;At first sight, it seems that it is impossible for the lipless humanoids to produce any sounds that involve the lips in their production, this concerns the following groups of sounds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bilabial consonants: pʰ p p' b m w&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;labiodental consonants: f v&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;labialised consonants: qʷ χʷ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rounded vowels: o u ɔ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But: There is a known art, named &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventriloquism" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ventriloquism&lt;/a&gt;, where replacement sounds for those sounds that require visible lip movement are used to produce understandable speech. Maybe the lipless humanoids can cope with this and even learn to produce the Gé̃kt's sounds using such techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm writing a book about humans finding alien writing off-planet, which is why I want to know how—without referencing known human languages like the Rosetta Stone does—it may be deciphered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it help to have children's books that teach aliens to read or spell, linguistic books with diagrams of alien phonology or morphology, or a Rosetta Stone with alien languages or dialects?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I don't know what the person who wrote that sentence intended, but pona sona or sona pona, the proper order, is usually translated as 'wisdom'. I also wouldn't use toki lawa to mean think. That's usually part of pilin (mi pilin e ni: = I think/feel this:). I would use toki lawa as demand/command, as in a way of saying somebody is speaking with authority, and expecting their order to be followed. jan lawa li toki lawa. li wile e ni: wile ona li kama pali. A boss/leader gives an order. He expects his wishes to be done. "Atilanisi is not even acceptable in toki pona either because "ti" is considered an 'illegal' syllable. If that is intended to say 'Atlantis' it would be something more like 'Alansi'. According to the transliteration rules, the most prominent consonants are used, replaced for similar sounds if neccesary (g becomes k, r becomes l or w, d becomes t, j becomes s), &amp; the rest are dropped if deemed not necessary. Sometimes letter pairs are reversed to make a CV syllable as in the case of Israel (Isale). The 'el' becomes 'le'. You are also generally discouraged from using more syllables than the original word. As far as the meaning of the sentence, I would translate it as "The wisdom of (strength of Libya) beside much/many Orders/commands(?) of vice president of Atlantis."&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The Chinese character system is one that is universal to many Chinese dialects. Two people can pronounce the same character in two different ways, but when writing to each other it is intelligible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have people used this opportunity to create a sort of conlang dialect of the language, and in doing so making up entirely new sound for the characters, and perhaps even making up new grammar too. I could image it even being a serious bastardizing of the characters too take on new meanings that would bring it closer to, say, a European language. Like how one uses the Latin alphabet to create a conlang. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Outright Chinese characters?

While the Grammar of Wede:i is available, only a little of its written system us described, and Uyseʔ is hardly online at all. This reflects more on the sheer amount of work to make an ideogram system presentable to the reader though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;It may be impossible.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All successful real-world language decipherments—Linear B, Egyptian, Hittite—have involved connections with other known languages. Linear B (Mycenaean) is closely related to Classical Greek, for example; Egyptian is related to Coptic and a bit more distantly to Hebrew and Arabic; Hittite is a distant relative to the whole Indo-European family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you only look at the writing system, figuring out Linear B involved connecting known place names like "Knossos" with words that were more common in inscriptions at Knossos than elsewhere. Ventris's biggest breakthrough came when he hypothesized that Kober's &lt;code&gt;??-C₄V₂-C₂V₂&lt;/code&gt; might be &lt;em&gt;k-no-so&lt;/em&gt;, which gave tentative values for C₂, C₄, and V₂, and extrapolated from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an alien language, we have no idea what names they used for places. We don't have any loanwords or names transcribed in other languages to compare against. We don't know if they use anything resembling phonetics to communicate—or if their language is even fundamentally based on recursion like ours is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;But…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe humans and Thulians have never made contact before, but the Borean language is known, and an ancient Borean imperial decree—translated into Thulian—is found in the excavations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Thulian and Borean are part of a language family—that hints to the linguists that Thulian might use a stack-based syntax (or whatever other weirdly inhuman feature you like) just like Borean does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe there's some old Thulian technology stored in Area 51, taken from a crashed spaceship; it contains records of an early Thulian attempt to figure out human languages (maybe even a rudimentary grammar of English written in Thulian).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe they can find a live Thulian, or, failing that, an artificial intelligence of some sort, which can give them real-time feedback—a native speaker is orders of magnitude more useful than any inscriptions can ever be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Thulian is related to some obscure Earth language(!). There used to be contact between Earth and Thule, which stopped millennia ago, and Thulian shares a distant ancestor of Etruscan/Sumerian/Pirahã/your favorite real-world language isolate. (Though be prepared for a lot of strong linguistic opinions if you decide to weigh in on the Pirahã controversy!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe universal grammar (in whatever form you like) is universal even across planets, and Thulian still has recognizable levels of phonology, morphology, and syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these on their own would make decipherment &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;—but the more you add, the easier it gets. At some point, it becomes &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;, and that's what matters for a story.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Conlangs and programming languages are different things. 
Conlangs are languages designed for human communication. For human to human communication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No programming language can be regarded as a language in that sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Riley Martine's example uses
python-like syntax. But at the same time it uses real English words to convey the meaning. &lt;br&gt;Computer is not able to understand the meaning of these words, it just runs code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple Python example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;greetingString = "Hello"

print(greetingString)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer just set string "Hello" to variable greetingString and prints it to the screen.&lt;br&gt;
Computer does &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; understand the meaning of the word . For computer it's just a computer variable value, nothing else.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to be &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/devil%27s_advocate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Devil's Advocate&lt;/a&gt; here: In a way programming languages are constructed languages, but they are usually very specific and narrow in focus: one could view them as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublanguage" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;sublanguages&lt;/a&gt; aimed at expressing algorithms or annotating other information. An example for a human sublanguage would be the language of recipes. Words that have multiple meanings in English generally have only one specific meaning in a sublanguage. The syntactic structures are simplified, and often different from general English. Certain aspects of the range of human expressions are left out or limited (you might talk about emotions or feelings, but they would only relate to the food mentioned).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could design a programming language that is suited to expressing recipes, and it could be used to drive a cooking robot. That programming language could also be read by humans, who would understand the meaning of it, and could translate it into other languages. In this sense 'programming language' is a bit of a red herring: it's just a formal representation of meaning. And (propositional) meaning can easily be expressed in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;predicate calculus&lt;/a&gt; or related formalisms. Is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_dependency_theory" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;CD representation&lt;/a&gt; a conlang, or just an abstract representation of actions/states? It can certainly be transformed into any number of other languages (natural or constructed), and it can express a reasonable range of human activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do you draw the line? At what point does a constructed language cross the boundary between being simply a mark-up or programming language to being suitable for human communication? What is the essence that, say, HTML, is missing, but that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;toki pona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Klingon&lt;/a&gt;, or Esperanto have? Note: I'm not suggesting that HTML is a conlang, but it can be used to encode a specific kind of meaning, and XML can even &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;encode semantic relationships&lt;/a&gt;. But they might not be very suitable for inter-human communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could, though, envisage two people with no common language between them who use a programming language to work together on solving a problem. It would be tough, but should be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view there is a continuum between 'fully formed' languages on the one hand, and restricted or sublanguages on the other. While it is difficult to formally represent the more complex languages (because they are so complex), the simpler end of the spectrum can be encoded in such a representation. Predicate calculus is one representation, and any programming language is another one. There is no hard boundary between the two, so in a way (even though nobody would really 'speak' in a programming language) the answer is: yes, programming languages can be categorised as conlangs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;It is even almost impossible for human languages. For all successful decipherings of historical writing systems some kind of clue was needed in the form of a related extant language or dictionaries and/or bilingual documents with one already known language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a human group wants to leave something long-term decipherable, maybe they can prepare some teaching materials with rich illustrations to convey the gist of their language. Later readers may come up with some artificial pronunciation for their script not unlike &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_language#Egyptological_pronunciation" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Egyptological pronunciation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throwing in aliens makes it even more difficult: Even when the aliens follow the procedure outlined above, will humans be able to understand the graphical representations and pictures they use? Their body parts and their home environment may be very different from ours.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There have been serious attempts at this by NASA: the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pioneer Plaque&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Voyager Golden Record&lt;/a&gt;. The intention is for them to be received by aliens, who will be able to use them to find out about human culture (and then hopefully won't come over to subjugate us with their superior technology!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They use lots of universal physical and mathematical quantities as references, and with the understanding that any sufficiently advanced society will be able to identify them. For example the molecular structure of hydrogen, and a diagram of the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one key element for easy decipherability would be to have texts available describing something universally known across the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another would be to have a simple writing system. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Hangul&lt;/a&gt; is based on the positions of the vocal tract, which would be an aid for deciphering. It is somewhat complicated by combining multiple symbols in blocks, similarly to Egyptian hieroglyphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple grammar like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;toki pona&lt;/a&gt; would help to quickly discover regularities in the language. There are separators between the verb and the object, and there is usually only one verb per sentence. Complex sentences are broken down into a sequence of multiple sentences. Even without understanding the words, it is easy to identify the syntactic structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texts could be formulaic in structure. One clue that helped decipher German messages encoded with the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Enigma machine&lt;/a&gt; was their fixed structure, and the fact that they always ended in the same phrase, "Heil Hitler" -- that served as a useful anchor point when trying to work out the code. If your alien texts also have a similar structure, then you could use that to identify greetings or other formulaic expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most difficult aspect would be the vocabulary, especially abstract words, or polysemous words (ie words with multiple meanings). For this simple texts, or even encyclopedias and (monolingual) dictionaries would provide a good entrance point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most human languages follow certain quantitative regularities, which we now know about. There has been some work on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaistos_Disc" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Phaistos Disc&lt;/a&gt; which concluded that if it is a text in an unknown language, it is most likey to use a syllabic writing system, ie the symbols stand for syllables rather than letters. This can be derived from the frequency distribution of the symbols. Of course it might not be a text -- my pet hypothesis is that it is part of a board game :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, there are a number of aspects you could take into account for this. With what we know about languages and their properties nowadays, it should be quite convincing for a space mission to have a linguist as part of their team who could work on deciphering any foreign languages without too many problems. Of course it would also depend how close the alien culture was to human cultures. Language is only part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on the pronoun system of one of my conlangs, and I can't find any resource that can tell me how commonly reflexive pronouns occur in natural languages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is a reflexive something I need to add to be naturalistic? And if it isn't is there a specific reason/way a lack of reflexive pronouns occurs?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, you need a reflexive pronoun of some type if not having one causes ambiguity in who did what to whom. Assume English had no reflexives. "I tossed the ball to I" and "You tossed the ball to you" (assuming singular "you") are quite understandable as one person tossing the ball to themselves, thus no reflexive needed. "She tossed the ball to he", acceptable. But suppose you had "She tossed the ball to she", and it's been previously established there is more than one woman present. Did person A throw the ball to Person B, or did she toss the ball up in the air and caught it herself? There's no way to tell. An example like that is why German only has a distinctive reflexive in third person; first and second person don't have that same ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get rid of the reflexive entirely if your verb system, to use one possibility, allows a given verb to indicate if it takes a direct or indirect object, or if it does not. Let's say that English verbs used the affix &lt;em&gt;a-&lt;/em&gt; to indicate the verb is ditransitive (it has both a direct and indirect object) and no affix to indicate purely transitive (it only has a direct object).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She a-threw the ball to she." - Mary threw the ball to Susan.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she." - Mary threw the ball up in the air and caught it herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under a system like that, English wouldn't need a reflexive pronoun because the verb would make it clear whether the subject was performing the action on themselves, or using themselves as the indirect object, or whether something else was the recipient of the action. One could argue the affix &lt;em&gt;a-&lt;/em&gt; is similar to the single Icelandic reflexive pronoun that's used for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Inuktitut, verbs that are are equivalent to English intransitive verbs use one suffix attached to them to indicate the subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;pisuk &lt;em&gt;to walk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;pisuktunga &lt;em&gt;I am walking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;pisuktutit &lt;em&gt;You (singular) are walking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;pisuktuq &lt;em&gt;He/She/It is walking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific verbs, equivalent to transitive verbs, use a different set of suffixes that indicate both subject and object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;qukiq &lt;em&gt;to shoot something&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;qukiqtagit &lt;em&gt;I shoot you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;qukiqtara &lt;em&gt;I shoot him/her/it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;qukiqtarma &lt;em&gt;You shoot me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;qukiqtait &lt;em&gt;You shoot him/her/it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;qukiqtaanga &lt;em&gt;He/she/it shoot me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;qukiqtaatit &lt;em&gt;He/she/it shoot you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;qukiqtanga &lt;em&gt;He/she/it shoot that other he/she/it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's where the reflexives come in: if you don't use the second set of suffixes, but instead use the first set, then the verb becomes a reflexive: the subject did something to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;qukiqtunga &lt;em&gt;I shoot myself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;qukiqtutit &lt;em&gt;You shoot yourself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;qukiqtuq &lt;em&gt;He/She/It shoot themself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attaching the suffix that goes on intransitive verbs onto a transitive verb turns that verb into a reflexive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if your verb conjugation allows that sort of thing, then you can get away with not using reflexive pronouns. The verb indicates it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if your verb doesn't allow you to do that, then you need reflexives in order to remove the ambiguity when you get into situations where it's not clear who is doing what to whom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way: go back to that first English example I used. Suppose English had multiple third person singular pronouns, such that you didn't just have "she", but "she-1", "she-2", and perhaps more. Then what does the example look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She-1 threw the ball to she-2." - Mary threw the ball to Susan.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She-1 threw the ball to she-1." - Mary threw the ball up in the air and caught it herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No ambiguity. The context makes it clear that Mary is she-1 (Mary had the ball, she-1 threw the ball, therefore Mary is she-1, so Susan is she-2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third option is context. You might have a language where you do need to gather more information in order to determine what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she. Susan threw it back." - Mary obviously threw the ball to Susan.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she. Susan then asked for the ball." - Mary apparently didn't throw the ball to Susan, since Susan asked for it after it had been thrown and caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, three possible ways to get away without reflexive pronouns. So it's not a matter of how common or uncommon it is, but does the grammar of the language allow you to get away without them, or is it necessary because there's no other way of providing the same information?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>

  &lt;p&gt;qukiqtarma &lt;em&gt;You shoot me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;qukiqtait &lt;em&gt;You shoot him/her/it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;qukiqtaanga &lt;em&gt;He/she/it shoot me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;qukiqtaatit &lt;em&gt;He/she/it shoot you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third option is context. You might have a language where you do need to gather more information in order to determine what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she. Susan threw it back." - Mary obviously threw the ball to Susan.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Mary and Susan were on the field. Mary had the ball. She threw the ball to she. Susan then asked for the ball." - Mary apparently didn't throw the ball to Susan, since Susan asked for it after it had been thrown and caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, three possible ways to get away without reflexive pronouns. So it's not a matter of how common or uncommon it is, but does the grammar of the language allow you to get away without them, or is it necessary because there's no other way of providing the same information?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Syllables are inherent to the spoken language and a native of that language will take a certain grouping of letters and turn it into a set of syllables according to that language’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In German, hyphenation generally follows syllables boundaries. About a decade ago, an article in a newspaper talked about the Chinese city of Shenyang but hyphenated it &lt;em&gt;Sheny-ang&lt;/em&gt;. From a German point of view that could have been an acceptable syllable grouping if y is considered a vowel as &lt;em&gt;ya&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;ia&lt;/em&gt;) is not an acceptable diphthong, but &lt;em&gt;Shen-yang&lt;/em&gt; (y as a half-vowel) would also have worked. For Chinese, only &lt;em&gt;Shen-yang&lt;/em&gt; is possible because of the very restricted set of syllables. In Japanese, &lt;em&gt;Shen-yan(g)&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;She-nyan(g)&lt;/em&gt; (strictly speaking, Japanese doesn’t have an ng sound unless k or g follow) would be possible with a y in the spelling; &lt;em&gt;She-ni-an(g)&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Shen-i-an(g)&lt;/em&gt; would strictly require an i in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you maybe see, what will be seen depends on the language, and only what is possible will be produced. Another example is Japanese again, which only has open syllables or those ending in n. So when a Japanese tries to pronounce &lt;em&gt;startling&lt;/em&gt;, that tends to end up somewhere near &lt;em&gt;sutartolingu&lt;/em&gt;, a five-syllable (seven-mora) word. Thus, a speaker of your conlang will not even consider &lt;em&gt;ep-se&lt;/em&gt; a possibility but will default to &lt;em&gt;e-pse&lt;/em&gt;, if that is all the language does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, some languages with loose syllable rules still tend to end up with ambiguity. For example, the Finnish place Yli-Ii will have to have a hyphen to signify the short-long sequence. The German word &lt;em&gt;Bakterien&lt;/em&gt; has an unusual syllable boundary between i and e (&lt;em&gt;Bak-te-ri-en&lt;/em&gt;) while &lt;em&gt;ie&lt;/em&gt; usually just signifies a long /i/ sound. Those things will need to be learnt at school, there is no way to predict.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking what is the correct way to say "Little princess" in Ido.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(EN) Little princess - Little (indicates the "size") Princess (descendant of some royal crown and that descendant is female).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ES) Princesita - Princes (root), -it- (suffix for "litte"), -a (indicates female gender).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should translate as in english like "Mikra princino"? or in the Spanish way like "Princetino"? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ido suffixes are agglutinative, is there a particular order? "-et" suffix for little "-in" for female... we could get "Princineto".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;After a research, I finally found this example which explains this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;si quieres decir una perra (adulta) pequeña, el orden adecuado es entonces perra+pequeña = hundineto. El orden contrario es poco natural y hace dudar al que oye la palabra &lt;em&gt;hundetino = perrito hembra&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the valid ones for Little princess are:
1. Mikra princino = "Little" + "female descendant of some royal crown"
2. Princineto = A female descendant of some royal crown who is little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Princetino" would be like:
A little descendant of some royal crown who is female.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Yes, they show. Slovio is not a zonal conlang, it is supposed to be a kind of Slavic Esperanto. It took place 20 years ago, but nowadays noone wants to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Interslavic is comprehensible for all Slavic people. Speaker of Interslavic went abroad to different Slavic countries and expressed their idea using Interslavic instead of native languages or English. And it worked. People understand the meaning, though the language can sound strange or event funny to them. And if it does, Interslavic is a viable project and succeeds in its challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;"Omnilingual" was mentioned in comments, and there's your answer; assuming you have two technologically and scientifically advanced cultures, there are universal constants that can be used as a basis that historical examples on Earth didn't have, and thus we can't use to decipher old languages. The story used the discovery of the Martian periodic table as the clue that allowed the breakthrough because there is only one periodic table; chemistry and atoms are the same everywhere. To use an example inspired by that story, if you see something like "frazzlump + frazzlump + bork = blarg", and "frazzlump" is the first entry in the table and "bork" is the eighth, you know "blarg" probably means "water".&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Exactly what it says on the can - I'm looking for a word in &lt;code&gt;tlhingan-Hol&lt;/code&gt; (Klingon) for "skull".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fallback: In case there isn't a canon word, I'm defaulting to using "head bone" as a replacement. I know from TKD that &lt;code&gt;nach&lt;/code&gt; is "head" and &lt;code&gt;Hom&lt;/code&gt; is "bone". Is this combination &lt;code&gt;nach Hom&lt;/code&gt; correct? e.g. is &lt;code&gt;jaghpu'ma' nach HomDu'&lt;/code&gt; a reasonable translation for "our enemies' skulls"?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to translate this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;"May we drink from the empty skulls of our enemies"&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to &lt;code&gt;tlhIngan-Hol&lt;/code&gt; / Klingon, this will be used as a toast at a friends' wedding (of all things). While my understanding of Klingon grammar is pretty basic, this task seems reasonable enough. Using The Klingon Dictionary I've got this far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;jaghpu'ma' chim nach HomDu'vaD matlhutlhjaj&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;jaghpu'ma'&lt;/code&gt; is "our enemies" &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;chim&lt;/code&gt; is "be empty" &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;nach&lt;/code&gt; is "head", &lt;code&gt;Hom&lt;/code&gt; is bone - I'm using &lt;code&gt;nach HomDu'&lt;/code&gt; as a stand-in for "skulls" unless I find something better (see my &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/q/1024/591"&gt;other question&lt;/a&gt;*)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-vaD&lt;/code&gt; (if I understand correctly) marks the sentence so far as a purpose clause, so roughly "used for"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;matlhutlh&lt;/code&gt; is "we drink"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-jaj&lt;/code&gt; makes the sentence into a "wish", &lt;code&gt;XXXjaj&lt;/code&gt; translates as "may XXX".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a rough literal translation back to English is something like "May we drink using our enemies' empty head-bones" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this correct? Any way to translate the sentence better?
Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

This is not a duplicate the question &lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/q/1024/591"&gt;Is there a word for 'skull' in Klingon&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; question asks for a specific word while &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; question deals with the validity and best phrasing of a sentence (regardless what's the best Klingon term for that specific term).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-jaj&lt;/code&gt; makes the sentence into a "wish", &lt;code&gt;XXXjaj&lt;/code&gt; translates as "may XXX".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a rough literal translation back to English is something like "May we drink using our enemies' empty head-bones" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this correct? Any way to translate the sentence better?
Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there doesn't seem to be any canon word for "skull" in Klingon, so a compound should be fine.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, however, that some compounds are constructed without separation between their parts (see for example &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Klingon_compound_words" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wiktionary's list of Klingon compound words&lt;/a&gt;) with no apparent rule as to why, so "skull" could conceivably be &lt;code&gt;nachHom&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT, since &lt;code&gt;-Hom&lt;/code&gt; is also the diminutive suffix, &lt;code&gt;nachHom&lt;/code&gt; would primarily mean "little skull", making &lt;code&gt;nach Hom&lt;/code&gt; is the less ambiguous translation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm going to assume that the aliens' language is intentionally easy to decipher and that they are actively trying to allow other species to piece together the meaning of what they produce. I'm also going to assume that these are written or written-ish artifacts and what they look like might differ from how the aliens actually communicate in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think the semantic content of individual signs is going to be obvious or easy to infer, but you can keep their overall number low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can have conventions in the orthography that make the grammatical structure really obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can have no irregular inflection and encode the parse tree directly in the orthography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;( and ( possible ( ( not have ) ( and [ Change Word ] ( not ( can predict ) ) ) ) )
    ( possible ( ( encode directly ) [ Tree Meaning ] ( in [ System Writing ] ) ) ) )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example above consistently marks non-predicates with Capitalization and uses brackets to mark compounds where the meaning of the whole compound is pragmatically inferable from the meaning of its constituents but not directly implied by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another idea is to make the thing that humans discover a &lt;em&gt;computer&lt;/em&gt; or some other kind of interactive piece of alien technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be easy for humans to test their hypotheses about how the aliens' language worked if the computer was capable of answering questions formulated in the language or if the program would attempt to correct mistakes and either show the corrected response or prompt the user to pick a corrected response before answering.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I plan on having some ambiguity for stuff like wordplay (and to make the language feel natural). By efficient, I mean the language takes up little space on the document it is conveying information on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is the language would be "alien" or "magical" as I am planning on using this language I am making in my game for magical symbols. I plan on eventually adding a spoken equivalent of it later, but I am not concerned about that now. It is also going to be part of the lore of my game, so the naturalness of the language helps a lot (so it can have a history to it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wordplay can be used to have magical mishaps from using a similar, but wrong word. The last thing I plan on adding is since it is a magic based language, I only need to have one symbol per word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the grammatical structure would convey:
&lt;code&gt;Subject, Verb, Action&lt;/code&gt;. I would then use adjectives to modify the meaning of the subject, action, or verb. However, I don't know if I am going to include articles in the languages, but that depends on how I make the characters for the subjects, verbs, and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not meant to be a romance language as its purpose is for use in spells and potion recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guess what I am asking for is how to make the language use grammar and structure that can be read and written efficiently. How would I make grammar and language structure that can be read and written efficiently?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I was reading &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;International Auxiliary Language&lt;/a&gt;, but I don't like their setups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, mostly, they use Latin alphabets!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that, my friends, cause confusions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what the letter was intended to be pronounced, EVERY country (especially those use uses Latin alphabets such as English, German, French, Spanish, etc.) WILL pronounce it in their own way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'J' is pronounced 'h' in Spanish, 'z' in French, 'y' in German.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many country also have different pronunciation for 'H' and 'R'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, many countries are even "incapable of" pronouncing letters such as 'RR' in Spanish or 'Ü' in German!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to those drawbacks, the invented language bound to be less efficient than it was intended to be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I was thinking, is there a way to overcome such drawbacks!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, the most obvious approach is to find a set of alphabets that "Nobody had in common"! At least, find those letters that are used by "only one country"! Such as some letters in Greek alphabets (As far as I know, Greek are the only country that use Greek alphabets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I think it's better to divide that alphabets into 2 group. First group are those letters that "every people in every country know how to pronounce". I think it's good to base it on Japanese, because Japanese has the least amount of pronunciations as far as I know. I believe they are the easiest language to learn pronunciation-wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This group of letters build up the "basic and conceptual words", where all other words are the "combination product" of these words. You can think it as the "building block" of the words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I think it's better to make the words "a word a syllable" such as Chinese. And 1-syllable words made from the "Basic letters" are the "building block" of the words. More complicated words are the combination of these "basic conceptual words". Such as "Refrigerator" are actually "Electronic Ice Box" in Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think it's better to make the letters "phonetic"! 'A' is always pronounced 'a' NO MATTER WHAT! Unlike English, 'A' has 2 million ways of pronunciation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second group of letters are those pronunciations that "All the countries in the world that &lt;strong&gt;COULD EVER MADE&lt;/strong&gt;! I know this might sounds like far fetching, but the idea is "Easy for everybody to learn such language. And for those who are familiar with the language, it will be easy for them to learn &lt;strong&gt;EVERY LANGUAGE&lt;/strong&gt;"!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think it as "The first group letters are the intersection of the pronunciations of every language, and the second group are the union of the pronunciations of every language".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the second group of letters are only used for those more advanced, probably grammatical, concepts. Which is "Unnecessary for basic conversations but critical for literature".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my question is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are such ideas feasible? What's the ups-and-downs, pros-and-cons of my ideas? Did I miss something? What else should I pay special attention to?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;You seem to be confusing sounds with their representation in writing; similarly, countries and languages are not equivalent either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;inventory of sounds&lt;/a&gt; that are used in human languages; though most languages only use a small portion of it. If you are aiming for an international language, you should probably select those sounds that are common to most or all languages. I believe that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;toki pona&lt;/a&gt; comes close to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representing these &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; in writing is a completely different matter. Because different languages use the same letter to represent different sounds, your best bet might be to make up a completely new alphabet; then you don't have any pre-conceived notions of pronunciation to struggle with. On the flip side, everybody then has to learn the letters and how to pronounce them, which makes your language harder to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your question you also touch on morphology: that is a whole different field, which you should probably put in a separate question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to summarise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each language has an inventory of sounds it uses, these are called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;phonemes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;phonemes are represented in writing by letters; this is not a 1:1 mapping, and also
depends on accents and dialectal variation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Letters can have diacritics (such as the dots on top of the &lt;em&gt;&amp;uuml;&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;mdash; these usually make them separate letters from the base form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the letter-phoneme mapping is arbitrary; there is nothing inherent in the letter that determines how it should be pronounced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general I would recommend that you read up on some of the concepts of linguistics, as that would make it easier for you to express what exactly you want to achieve. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;First a in this form brand new fact from natural languages: All natural languages are of approximately the same efficiency despite their quite noticeable differences (some languages are spoken at a rather fast pace in syllables per second, but than the information content of a syllable is lower than in other languages that are spoken more slowly). The reference is &lt;a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/9/eaaw2594" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Christophe Coupé, Yoon Oh, Dan Dediu, and François Pellegrino, Different languages, similar encoding efficiency: Comparable information rates across the human communicative niche&lt;/a&gt; and they give a value of &lt;code&gt;39 ± 5 bit/s&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can expect that a naturalistic constructed language will fall in about the same range; maybe somewhat less efficient, because it is difficult to get things just right by construction that have been optimised by language evolution over a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For completely symbolic languages, look up the term &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasigraphy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pasigraphy&lt;/a&gt; and take a glimpse on some systems that have already been invented.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Mathematics consists of various names, relationships, etc. that have been consciously constructed and developed over time. On the other hand its a "formal" language whose scope is extremely specialized compared to a regular language. How else does mathematics compare/contrast with constructed languages?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;So I had an idea for a PC game that harkens somewhat to my ancestors... Imagine a fictional world blessed with angels, dragons, elves and fey and lots more, where technology is present but very rare in distribution, where most of the planet is still forested and wild. And where the setting takes place primarily on a fictional version of Ireland that is far larger than the real one. I'm Irish and Scandinavian, so I want to make a conlang that has Irish and Scandinavian elements to it, as well as viking elements. I want to make a written alphabet and language that follows what would of been the way the ancient people wrote , read and spoke "as close as possible anyway." And I have no idea where I should start. So what I am asking really is where should I begin? I have no clue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I think Programming and Mathematics fail to meet the standard because, despite being more precise, they are ultimately nowhere near as expressive as a language like English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per request I will expand on my answer. Take, for example, the English sentence "Jane missed the bus this morning and couldn't get to the office in time her interview, needless to say, she was not selected for the position." There is no way to express that in any programming language that I know of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var Jane = {Name:"Jane", Employment:"Unemployed", Bus:data.Buses[4]};
data.Buses[4].Depart("2019-10-05 07:30:00");
Jane.ArriveAt(data.Buses[4], "2019-10-05 07:45:00");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't go on trying the futile exercise of typing out a description of events in Javascript. Note that without knowing English the code makes no sense. Anything in code that isn't a keyword like "if" or "foreach" or "function" isn't part of the language and so you can only describe procedures for moving bits around, one way to illustrate this is to convert my Javascript to do the same thing, but with different variable names - the program will be exactly the same as far as the language specification goes and the resulting executable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var x = {a:"", b:"Unemployed", c:y.z[4]};
y.z[4].dp("2019-10-05 07:30:00");
x.w(y.z[4], "2019-10-05 07:30:00");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If those two paragraphs mean the exact same thing as far as the language is concerned, you've completely failed to communicate anything useful. Computer scientists working on artificial intelligence are working to make systems where "bus" is a keyword, there is an idea of "bus" in the language. Until that technology is fully realized, we will be stuck with programming languages that are limited to describing things a computer can understand, a much lesser standard than what a human can. This is what I mean by less expressive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are some syntax "toys" online, eg &lt;a href="http://www.zompist.com/gtg.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://www.zompist.com/gtg.html&lt;/a&gt;. This will help you write a (formal) grammar of your language, but you will need a good understanding of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_grammar" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Generative Linguistics&lt;/a&gt; to use that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, what else do you need instead of pen and paper? Maybe a spreadsheet to enter vocabulary? There are so many choices to be made on so many levels that it is not really possible to automate much of it. It's not as if you would enter a few characteristics into a form, press a button, and out comes a conlang :)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;We all had little experience to go on when we first started making languages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd actually recommend that you &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; make use of a conlang recipe resource.  What you end up doing is little more than making an invented language like how the recipe writer makes an invented language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This just defeats the purpose of the art of glossopoesy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I'd suggest you take what experience you've got, little as it may be, and just do the hard work of language invention.  Sit down with pencil and paper and doodle words and phrases thereon.  Come up with some basic rules (for word order, for syllable structure, for grammar).  Get yourself hooked up with a good language invention community (&lt;a href="https://listserv.brown.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=CONLANG" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Conlang-L&lt;/a&gt; for example) and begin the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;This may be a stretch and probably not what you’re looking for, but:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, that’s what Japanese did. Japanese and Chinese have nothing in common, yet when the Chinese writing system made it to Japan over 1000 years ago it was the only one they had. Initially, it was used only to write Chinese, but then it was developed into a system suitable to write Japanese via many intermediate steps and multiple parallel paths. Now, centuries later, Japanese has:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some characters that are identical to (traditional) Chinese ones with the meanings being preserved, e.g. 大 (large) or 中 (centre)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some characters whose written forms have been simplified from traditional Chinese but with the meanings being preserved, e.g. 国 (state) 売 (to sell)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two sets of characters that are radically simplified/modified from their traditional forms and used only for their phonetic value (katakana and hiragana)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;some characters whose written forms are as in traditional Chinese but whose meanings have departed. The best example I could find was 豚 which means &lt;em&gt;pig&lt;/em&gt; in Japanese but &lt;em&gt;piglet&lt;/em&gt; in Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Of course, some characters’ meanings departed in Chinese while they are still used in their original sense in Japanese like 湯 (&lt;em&gt;hot water&lt;/em&gt; in Japanese and old Chinese; &lt;em&gt;soup&lt;/em&gt; in modern Chinese; they shouldn’t be listed in a separate bullet point because they generally fit the first)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;compound words composed of more than one character with a meaning akin to the Chinese one&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;compound words composed of more than one character with a completely different meaning (手紙 which in Japanese means &lt;em&gt;letter&lt;/em&gt; (the one you send) but in Chinese is toilet paper)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;entirely newly created written compounds, often spelt with hiragana and kanji to better reproduce Japanese grammar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;new characters created by combining individual parts, e.g. 働 (to work) made from the individual symbols 人 (man, person) and 動 (to move); the former regularly becomes a ‘pole with a steep hat’ in compounds such as 休&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Japanese and Chinese are linguistically so different (Chinese can have closed syllables, it has tones, the vowel registers differ and more), the Japanese pronunciation of Chinese characters obviously differs substantially from their original at the time of borrowing. In general, most characters can be pronounced in two or more ways depending on their surrounding. These pronunciations are grouped into &lt;em&gt;kun&lt;/em&gt; (have nothing to do with the Chinese original pronunciation; this is a Japanese word with a similar or identical meaning) and &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; (more or less loosely modelled on the Chinese pronunciation when the character was borrowed which may have happened more than once). However, even &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; pronunciations can be considered a simplification at best; a bastardisation of th original pronunciation may be more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differences notwithstanding, I know one Chinese who claims to be able to get the basic gist of written Japanese and with some crude knowledge of Japanese I was able to grasp the meanings of some things written in Chinese on Taiwan recently. So a certain degree of intelligibility seems to be conserved.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In creating an ancestral lang for a hard-fantasy world that is based on the language of your home, you first have to understand that language.  And for an impatient worldbuilder like me, the Vulgar Language Generator seems the best place to go.  Click the "English" choice, and you automatically get the following consonant clusters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word initial&lt;/strong&gt;:  b bɹ d dj ʤ f fj fɹ h j k kj kw kɹ l m n nj p pl pɹ s sm sp st t tɹ ʧ v w ð g gɹ ɹ ʃ ʍ θ θɹ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-word&lt;/strong&gt;:  b bl d f ft fɹ h k l ldɹ lm ls lw lɹ m mb ms mθ n nd ndɹ nl ns nt ntɹ nɹ p pl s st sʧ t ts tw ʧ v w z zn ð ŋgl g ɹ θ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word final&lt;/strong&gt;:  b d dz ʤ f ft k ks kst kt l ld lf lp lt lvz m md mz n nd ndz nst nt nʧ nz p ps pt s skt st t ts ʧ v vd z ð ŋ ŋk ŋz g ɹ ʃ θ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vowels&lt;/strong&gt;:  aɪ aʊ eɪ i iə iː oː u uː æ ɑː ɒ ɔ ɔɪ ɔː ə əʊ ɛ ɛː ɜː ɪ ɪə ʊə ʌ ʊ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are some things in English that came naturally before knowing about it, like affixes, sound-verb-object and adjective before noun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are some things about English that I know nothing about, like its dropoff rate.  Vulgar defined dropoff rate as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Phonemes are ranked by frequency from left (most frequent) to right (least frequent). &lt;strong&gt;Medium&lt;/strong&gt; makes the frequencies slightly more even than &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt;. When using &lt;strong&gt;equiprobable&lt;/strong&gt;, phonemes can be custom weighted by writing &lt;strong&gt;=multiplier&lt;/strong&gt;, eg: &lt;strong&gt;p=10&lt;/strong&gt; makes p ten times more common than a phoneme without a weighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vulgar gives us choices for our phonemes:  "fast", "medium" or "equiprobable" for dropoff rate and "naturalistic ranking", "natural with randomness", "alphabetical" or "previous" for how to arrange the phonemes.  Which of these choices matches English in real life?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Note that by synthesising vocabulary using a tool like Vulgar Lang, you will not even approximate English even when using the same distributional laws for phonemes. You will get a lot of words that could be English, but are just unused, you get known words but with other meanings, and you don't get morphology or syntax at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, "naturalistic ranking" is the best approximation, all other rankings lead to feelable statistical distortions given your conlang an engeneered touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alternative I suggest looking at the questions and answers under &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/diachronics" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'diachronics'" rel="tag"&gt;diachronics&lt;/a&gt;: Start with real life English and apply systematic changes to the sounds and the grammar. For an example using projection of current trends into the future, you can look at &lt;a href="http://jbr.me.uk/futurese.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Futurese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;If you're wed to the idea of using Vulgar to make English nonsense words, the best idea would likely be to manually set the dropoff rate using "equiprobable" and custom weights, as it's unlikely that any of the default options precisely match English text. If you can find out what the rate of occurrence of different English phonemes is, putting them in manually in this way would almost definitely be more accurate than relying on the defaults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have any resources that list explicit measures for the rates of occurrences of various English phonemes on hand, but they likely exist; I'll certainly edit some into this answer if I find any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a fascinating document!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following issues of &lt;em&gt;Sionsharfe&lt;/em&gt; also contain shorter or longer fragments of Volapük, unfortunately the digisat ends with Nr 48 (1880), there are four more years missing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;IPA&lt;/a&gt;, many alphabets are so close that they are indistinguishable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such as [bʊk], [ɓʊk], or [βʊk]. Even though they DO have some minor differences, but all the listener heard is "book".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is there any "Simplified IPA" where they contain all possible pronunciations but yet omit all those indistinguishable alphabets!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;If you're notating a language that uses [β] or [ɓ] &lt;em&gt;but does not distinguish it&lt;/em&gt; from [b], that is, if there are no words such that changing one of these consonants to the other changes the meaning of the word, then for most purposes you write it as /b/; so that is a “simplified IPA”.  This is called &lt;strong&gt;broad&lt;/strong&gt; transcription, written with slashes to distinguish it from &lt;strong&gt;narrow&lt;/strong&gt; transcription using brackets.  A famous example: English /p/ includes both [p] and [pʰ], which are distinguished in many languages including Zulu, Hindustani, Mandarin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No language makes phonemic distinctions between &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; pairs of phones represented by distinct symbols in IPA; but every symbol exists because &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; language contrasts it with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No language makes phonemic distinctions between &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; pairs of phones represented by distinct symbols in IPA; but every symbol exists because &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; language contrasts it with others.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Here are some solutions, roughly in descending order of naturalness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distance-specific determiners or inflections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;topic-prominence and a dedicated pronoun for referring back to the topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch-reference on nonfinite verbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pro-forms incorporating some feature such as the first sound of a word.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1 distance-specific determiners or inflections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can solve this problem in a reasonably natural way using demonstratives or distance-specific determiners. This is similar to proximate and obviative pronouns, but not identical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, suppose all non-vocative uses of names require some kind of definite determiner. And suppose there are proximal and distal determiners ("this" and "that"). I'm also assuming that these determiners can form NPs without an accompanying noun, like in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then you could say something to the effect of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;this Adam sent essay to that James to help that with that's writing.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of variation in existing natural languages when it comes to contrasts in demonstratives. Some languages surface distinctions such as visibility (e.g. Malagasy) or audibility (e.g. Khaling, a Sino-Tibetan language from Nepal) or altitude/elevation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2 topic-prominence and a dedicated pronoun for referring back to the topic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reflexive pronoun solution described above normally tracks co-reference with the syntactic subject of the matrix clause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that solution is not flexible enough, you can track co-reference with the topic instead and explicitly mark the topic in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose James is the topic and TOP is the pronoun that refers to the topic. Let the postposition/clitic は mark the topic of a clause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;to James は Adam sent essay to help TOP with TOP's writing.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you could do something like the following if you want は to obscure the role of the topicalized noun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;James は Adam sent essay to help TOP with TOP's writing.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, no topic prominent natural languages actually do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3 switch reference on non-finite verbs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switch reference marks whether the subject of a clause is the same as the previous clause or not. Suppose each verb is marked SS for same subject or DS for different subject. I'll assume utterance-initial words are marked with &lt;code&gt;DS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires some care in defining what exactly "previous clause" means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Adam sent.DS essay to James to help.SS him with his writing.DS .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so in this sentence, &lt;code&gt;sent.DS&lt;/code&gt; marks that &lt;code&gt;sent&lt;/code&gt; is in an utterance-initial clause. &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; receives a same subject marker because &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sent&lt;/code&gt; have the same subject, sort of, and writing has a &lt;code&gt;DS&lt;/code&gt; marker because James is writing, not Adam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the details right on how exactly you want pervasive switch-reference to work might be a bit tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4 pro-forms incorporating some feature such as the first sound of a word.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have some forms consisting &lt;code&gt;some constant&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;ona&lt;/code&gt;, which can refer back to a noun beginning with that particular consonant sound (or &lt;code&gt;ona&lt;/code&gt; itself if the word begins with a vowel). Then you can do something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Adam sent essay to James to help JONA with JONA's writing.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the choice of &lt;code&gt;JONA&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;ONA&lt;/code&gt; means that James is the one whose writing we're attempting to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Here are some possible solutions to this problem that haven't been listed already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mark case with tone or another suprasegmental feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;case disfixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a large class of indeclinable nouns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;achieve free word order via noun classes and agreement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1 Case Tone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maasai_language#Syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Maasai&lt;/a&gt; marks case with tone. It's predominantly VSO, but frequently uses VOS order if the object is more topical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2 Case disfixes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some languages like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disfix#Muskogean" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Alabama (Muskogean, North America)&lt;/a&gt; delete phonemes in a root to indicate pluractionality (plural subject/plural object/multiple repetitions), basically verbal number. You can repurpose this feature for case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a strawman example in a 3-case language (direct, oblique, and genitive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;direct case: unmarked
oblique case: delete the final phoneme
genitive case: delete the final 2 phonemes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose &lt;code&gt;chopal&lt;/code&gt; means house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;house                 chopal
to/from/&amp;c the house  chopa
the house's           chop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3 have a large class of indeclinable nouns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have a fair number of nouns that &lt;em&gt;don't decline at all&lt;/em&gt; before the declension system breaks down completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeclinable nouns can end in whatever you want them to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might work well if your language has optional prepositions or postpositions with the same meaning as certain cases so that the role of an indeclinable noun can be clarified if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. noun classes and agreement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some languages such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_grammar#Verbs" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Swahili&lt;/a&gt; have many noun classes and require verbs to agree with their arguments. Many Bantu languages like Swahili have agreement with direct objects as well, but don't require its usage in all situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also achieve the same effect with obligatory clitic doubling, such as in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitic_doubling#Macedonian_and_Bulgarian" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Macedonian&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that you must have a pronoun referring to various verb arguments (such as the direct object) even when a full noun phrase is present. Clitic doubling is more effective at disambiguating sentences if you have more noun classes or more grammatical numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Most languages I am familiar with have six different person/number combinations for verbs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Singular&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st (&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd (&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd (&lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Plural&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st (&lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd (&lt;em&gt;you (all)&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd (&lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, verb conjugation is more complicated than just these combinations (other features include tenses, aspects, mood (eg imperative), and gerunds), but for now, just focus on person/number. Is there some way to collapse these six combinations into five? On a related note, are there any natural languages with five conjugations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I need exactly five conjugations. Are there normal languages with only five conjugations? If there aren't, what would be the most realistic way to implement this?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't immediately dismiss this!&lt;/strong&gt; Just give me a moment to explain and you might realize it's an idea that might have merit, especially considering the question title is a little misleading. Also, I'm no conlang or linguistics expert, so if there's a couple small things I got wrong but don't necessarily make this impossible, especially if fixing it might make it possible, correct me in the comments and I'll integrate it into my question to make the question something that can actually be answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could you construct a language--or, at least, a grammar system--with only three words? OK, so first of all, "word" is not the proper term for what I'm trying to say, but I don't know of a term that fits. So. When I say three words, I mean three combinations of consonants and vowels that morphemes can be derived from. From now on, though, I'm going to refer to them as "words", just because it's the only term that vaguely fits. Again, don't dismiss me immediately. Let me explain my idea, and then please critique it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three base words would each have particular consonants and one particular vowel, in the structure 1v2v3 (where v represents the vowel, and the numbers represent the three consonants). For a silly example, let's say the three words are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sazar&lt;/strong&gt;: Fire (s, z, r; a)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kitiv&lt;/strong&gt;: Lie (k, t, v: i)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lomon&lt;/strong&gt;: Truth (l, m, n; o)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If I were to actually construct this language, I would &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; use different base words, but let's stick with these for the sake of example.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are thirteen distinct combinations of these letters to be derived from these words (1, 2, 3, v, 1v, 2v, v2, v3, 1v2, 2v3, v2v, 1v2v, v2v3), and that's without rearranging the letters at all. If you allow for rearranging letters, there are thirty-one  distinct combinations (if I did my math right). Including the original "word", it's thirty-two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these combinations templates can result in 96 different roots/suffixes/prefixes/morphemes/etc. If you somehow made each combination represent some kind of modifier that can be made to a root word, could you construct, if not a language, then at least a grammar system, this way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if we made v3 represent plurality (-iv=singular, -on=plural, -ar=dual) and v2 represent person (-it=first person, -om=third person, and -az=second person) then that could be the conjugation for the language, giving you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;: -itiv&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;: -aziv&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He/She/It&lt;/strong&gt;: -omiv&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We&lt;/strong&gt;: -iton (or -itar for special, dual cases)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You pl.&lt;/strong&gt;: -azon (or -azar for special, dual cases)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They&lt;/strong&gt;: -omon (or -omar for special, dual cases)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, -omiv could be extended using v1, which would represent gender (-as=neuter, -ik=female, -ol=male). Using this, the conjugation for he would be the way-too-long-for-conjugation "-omivol".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could make a modifier for roots that determine whether it's a noun, verb, or adjective, and you could also have the three tenses (it's fascinating how much language fits into groups of three) and make cases using combinations of the vowels and consonants, and you would have to stretch some things for prepositions, but maybe instead of having prepositions be words, you could make this an entirely written language and use visuals to convey prepositions (essentially making sentence order influence the physical positions of the objects the words refer to, instead of the grammatical meaning of the words).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would probably need to create a couple (or many) other roots that the modifiers would be added to (or at least start with more flexible words than fire, lie, and truth), but could I at least base the grammar system off of only the three original words and modifiers derived from those three words?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't see any obvious issues with this language, besides long words, but I would appreciate it if more experienced conlangers could critique this. Also, if there are no issues with a conlang with only the grammar based on the three base "words", what about an entire language, where you could only build basic words by combining roots based on the three base words? This would limit the number of morphemes you could use for grammar, which might be an issue if there are a certain grammatical components every language needs and there aren't enough morphemes for all the components.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't immediately dismiss this!&lt;/strong&gt; Just give me a moment to explain and you might realize it's an idea that might have merit, especially considering the question title is a little misleading. Also, I'm no conlang or linguistics expert, so if there's a couple small things I got wrong but don't necessarily make this impossible, especially if fixing it might make it possible, correct me in the comments and I'll integrate it into my question to make the question something that can actually be answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could you construct a language--or, at least, a grammar system--with only three words? OK, so first of all, "word" is not the proper term for what I'm trying to say, but I don't know of a term that fits. So. When I say three words, I mean three combinations of consonants and vowels that morphemes can be derived from. From now on, though, I'm going to refer to them as "words", just because it's the only term that vaguely fits. Again, don't dismiss me immediately. Let me explain my idea, and then please critique it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three base words would each have particular consonants and one particular vowel, in the structure 1v2v3 (where v represents the vowel, and the numbers represent the three consonants). For a silly example, let's say the three words are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sazar&lt;/strong&gt;: Fire (s, z, r; a)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kitiv&lt;/strong&gt;: Lie (k, t, v: i)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lomon&lt;/strong&gt;: Truth (l, m, n; o)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If I were to actually construct this language, I would &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; use different base words, but let's stick with these for the sake of example.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are thirteen distinct combinations of these letters to be derived from these words (1, 2, 3, v, 1v, 2v, v2, v3, 1v2, 2v3, v2v, 1v2v, v2v3), and that's without rearranging the letters at all. If you allow for rearranging letters, there are thirty-one  distinct combinations (if I did my math right). Including the original "word", it's thirty-two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these combinations templates can result in 96 different roots/suffixes/prefixes/morphemes/etc. If you somehow made each combination represent some kind of modifier that can be made to a root word, could you construct, if not a language, then at least a grammar system, this way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if we made v3 represent plurality (-iv=singular, -on=plural, -ar=dual) and v2 represent person (-it=first person, -om=third person, and -az=second person) then that could be the conjugation for the language, giving you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;: -itiv&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;: -aziv&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He/She/It&lt;/strong&gt;: -omiv&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We&lt;/strong&gt;: -iton (or -itar for special, dual cases)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You pl.&lt;/strong&gt;: -azon (or -azar for special, dual cases)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They&lt;/strong&gt;: -omon (or -omar for special, dual cases)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;If you have two features (number/person), it seems tricky to have five options (or any other odd number for that matter). However, there is an easy way: simply collapse singular and plural for one of the persons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is actually a real example in English (and several other languages): the &lt;em&gt;pluralis majestatis&lt;/em&gt; ("Royal We"). Simply discard the first person singular and use the first person plural instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not sure what other languages use this, but we have definitely heard it in English and German. It would not be surprising to us if it occurred in other languages as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds a bit odd, but would be an easy option.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Modern High German is like that: The verb endings for the 1pl and 3pl are always the same (e.g., &lt;em&gt;wir sind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sie sind&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;wir haben&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sie haben&lt;/em&gt;). Some dialects of German are going even further having the same endings for all plural forms.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Existing Other Person Conjugations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person#Additional_persons" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The wikipedia page on Grammatical Person&lt;/a&gt;, has this to say (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some Algonquian languages and Salishan languages divide the category of third person into two parts: &lt;strong&gt;proximate for a more topical third person, and obviative for a less topical third person&lt;/strong&gt;. The obviative is sometimes called the fourth person.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The term fourth person is also sometimes used for &lt;strong&gt;the category of indefinite or generic referents&lt;/strong&gt;, which work like one in English phrases such as "one should be prepared" or people in people say that..., when the grammar treats them differently from ordinary third-person forms. The so-called "zero person" in Finnish and related languages, in addition to passive voice may serve to leave the subject-referent open. Zero person subjects are sometimes translated as "one," but the problem with that is that English language constructions involving one, e.g. "One hopes that will not happen," are rare[citation needed] and could be considered expressive of an overly academic tone to the majority of people, while Finnish sentences like "Ei saa koskettaa" ("Not allowed to touch") are recognizable to and used by young children in both languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the grammatical persons of a language would be based on how the speakers of that language interact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would personally collapse singular and plural, and then think about what other possible persons there could be, adding &lt;strong&gt;fourth&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;fifth&lt;/strong&gt; person conjugations as is fitting, but you could also remove a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;No First Person&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you could have a heavy emphasis on an ego-less society, which would do away with the first-person. &lt;a href="http://martinedwardes.me.uk/pravic/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pravic&lt;/a&gt; would refer to the &lt;code&gt;"I"&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;"me"&lt;/code&gt; in the third person, as &lt;code&gt;"The speaker"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Class-Based Person&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you could have a language with a strong sense of caste or class, where there are separate second-person conjugations for people in higher, lower, or the same class.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the obvious first step is having a base form (be it nominative, accusative, ergative, absolutive or intransitive) with a null ending so that the root form with all its final sound variety actually shows up and can be identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, instead of attempting to find a declension pattern for each possible final sound, group them together. For example, you might have one (or many) declension groups that include words ending in consonant clusters; their feature may be that the ending tacked on always begins with a vowel to ensure a pronounceable syllable. On the other hand, you might decide to group together words ending in Vs, Vz, Vd and Vt (V = vowel sound) and have all their declension patterns be Vt + ending. These strategies reduce the potentially very high number of patterns to a more managable set – and are likely to have happened in natural languages anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would like to point out that Finnish and German are each rather close to what you have in mind. While native Finnish words can only /t, s, n, r, l/ or a vowel, loan words from other languages do not necessarily abide by this rule and newer loans have resisted change to fit Finnish phonotactics somewhat. In declensed forms, an /i/ is added between stem and ending to turn it into a fully allowed syllable. In German (subject to terminal devoicing) there aren’t any restrictions on final sounds that I am aware of. Indeed, declension is usually very simple being made up only of a sometimes optional filler-e plus a case-marking consonant so declension is not as complex as found in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;If this is a language, then it should be possible to express more than just three words. You would need to be able to say, for instance, "the dog bites the cat." Imagine that we derive dog from &lt;em&gt;sazar&lt;/em&gt;, bite from &lt;em&gt;kitiv&lt;/em&gt;, and cat from &lt;em&gt;lomon&lt;/em&gt; by reversing the consonants. Using only the grammatical information from your post and making some assumptions about syntax, we could form this sentence as &lt;em&gt;razas vitikomivik nomol&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this possible? If so, then this is a working language. However, once we define &lt;em&gt;razas&lt;/em&gt; to mean "dog," then we already have more than three words. &lt;em&gt;Razas&lt;/em&gt; isn't an inflected or declined form of &lt;em&gt;sazar&lt;/em&gt;; it's a new word formed by derivation. Even meanings related to the original word are a form of derivation (so making &lt;em&gt;razas&lt;/em&gt; mean "fire-creature" and using it for all animals still won't help). Once you create new words by derivation, the language has more than three words. In the language you described, every word is originally derived from three roots or base-words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you describe it, the language is entirely possible. There's an infinite number of morphemes in the three roots, if you allow for very long words and a lot of repetition. You have 96 syllables, so to use your possible syllables most efficiently, the 96 most common morphemes/words could have a syllable structure like &lt;em&gt;az&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;iv&lt;/em&gt;, your 96&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; next most common morphemes like &lt;em&gt;azaz&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;aziv&lt;/em&gt;, and your 96&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; next most common like &lt;em&gt;azazaz&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;azivaz&lt;/em&gt;, etc. But your vocabulary has to be limited to make sure that your longer morphemes (e.g. &lt;em&gt;aziv&lt;/em&gt;) not be confused with combinations of shorter ones (e.g. &lt;em&gt;az&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;iv&lt;/em&gt;) allowed for by your agglutinative morphology when they're not intended to be the same morpheme.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;If this is a language, then it should be possible to express more than just three words. You would need to be able to say, for instance, "the dog bites the cat." Imagine that we derive dog from &lt;em&gt;sazar&lt;/em&gt;, bite from &lt;em&gt;kitiv&lt;/em&gt;, and cat from &lt;em&gt;lomon&lt;/em&gt; by reversing the consonants. Using only the grammatical information from your post and making some assumptions about syntax, we could form this sentence as &lt;em&gt;razas vitikomivik nomol&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this possible? If so, then this is a working language. However, once we define &lt;em&gt;razas&lt;/em&gt; to mean "dog," then we already have more than three words. &lt;em&gt;Razas&lt;/em&gt; isn't an inflected or declined form of &lt;em&gt;sazar&lt;/em&gt;; it's a new word formed by derivation. Even meanings related to the original word are a form of derivation (so making &lt;em&gt;razas&lt;/em&gt; mean "fire-creature" and using it for all animals still won't help). Once you create new words by derivation, the language has more than three words. In the language you described, every word is originally derived from three roots or base-words.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;If you really mean "morphemes" or "phonemes", then yes, of course you could design your language this way. One straightforward example is the Morse code, composed of three symbols - dot, dash, pause. If you e.g. represent the dot and dash vocally as two different sounds (different duration, different pitch or whatever, or even the traditional &lt;em&gt;dit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dah&lt;/em&gt;), you can plausibly claim your language has only two phonemes (Though I would call it only a code of the main language it is used to encode, since it lacks its own grammar and vocabulary. But then, there are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-codes" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Q-codes&lt;/a&gt;, so nothing is absolute.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use three &lt;em&gt;syllables&lt;/em&gt;, it would be even easier - after all, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solresol" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Solresol&lt;/a&gt; manages with just seven, and &lt;a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%BE_%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B5#%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Marr's theory&lt;/a&gt; claims all (European?) the languages originate from just four syllables (but that is very much a pseudoscience, most famously &lt;a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC_%D0%B8_%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%8B_%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;debunked&lt;/a&gt; by no one else than J.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;There is of course Esperanto, conflating 2nd person singular and plural (let's ignore &lt;em&gt;ci&lt;/em&gt;), very much the same as in English. Although, since the verb does not change (by person/number), I would not call this a conjugation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other ways how to achieve &lt;em&gt;exactly five&lt;/em&gt; conjugations. E. g. in pre-1953 Slovak in the past tense (that is also used for the conditional), the singular distinguished three genders (masculine, feminine, neutrum), but the verb form stays the same for each person. While in plural, only two different forms are present - masculine animate and "everything else". 3+2=5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;masculine: 1st person &lt;em&gt;chodil som&lt;/em&gt;, 2nd person &lt;em&gt;chodil si&lt;/em&gt;, 3rd person &lt;em&gt;chodil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feminine: 1st person &lt;em&gt;chodila som&lt;/em&gt;, 2nd person &lt;em&gt;chodila si&lt;/em&gt;, 3rd person &lt;em&gt;chodila&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;neutrum: 1st person &lt;em&gt;chodilo som&lt;/em&gt;, 2nd person &lt;em&gt;chodilo si&lt;/em&gt;, 3rd person &lt;em&gt;chodilo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plural:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;masculine animate: 1st person &lt;em&gt;chodili sme&lt;/em&gt;, 2nd person &lt;em&gt;chodili ste&lt;/em&gt;, 3rd person &lt;em&gt;chodili&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other: 1st person &lt;em&gt;chodily sme&lt;/em&gt;, 2nd person &lt;em&gt;chodily ste&lt;/em&gt;, 3rd person &lt;em&gt;chodily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;som/si/sme/ste&lt;/em&gt; is an auxilliary verb).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary Czech has also exactly 5 conjugations in the past tense, but distributed differently (singular masculine, singular feminine+plural neutrum, singular neutrum, plural masculine animate, plural masculine inanimate+feminine)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;For my latest worldbuilding project I'm trying to create a naturalistic language for a fictional empire I've been creating. This empire was born at the end of the Bronze Age when various kingdoms and city states voluntarily united to defend against the growing power of a thalassocracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the story of the people who speak this language is more or less ironed out, I can't figure out how to proceed when devising a language for this multiethnic, multilingual and not-very centralised empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the languages spoken within the empire would all be related sister-languages derived from the same Proto-Lang I don't know how to determine wether one of these languages becomes more "prestigious" while the others remain as dialects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I just pick the language with more speakers? Do I just pick the language that the Emperor speaks, even if the rest of the (very powerful) nobility might speak another language entirely? Do I unite the languages in a single koinè? If so, how?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are a lot of possibilities, and many of them are attested in the history of natural languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Majority language wins. This happened in China at least twice, it was conquered and ruled by foreign people (Mongolians, Manchu), but the ruling class became sinified. It also happened in medieval France and Spain, they were conquered and ruled be Germanic tribes (Franks and Burgundians for France, Vandals and Goths for Spain), but the majority language of the residents won out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most prestigious language wins. This happend in antiquity in the Roman empire, and we see it in many post-colonial states in Africa. There are some prerequisites for that such as a working educational system helping that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Pidgins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Creoles&lt;/a&gt; emerge, and a Creole wins. This can be watched in Papua New Guinea, where Creole languages like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiri_Motu" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Police Motu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tok_Pisin" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Tok Pisin&lt;/a&gt; are becoming the &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; standard of communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something else happens. The case of English is not as clear as my points 1.–3. suggest: While the majority language finally won, it was heavily impacted and changed by the languages of the conquerors (Normans and Danes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT Stable multiliguality. Quite rare in the wild, but Switzerland with a coexistence of Swiss German, French, and Italian is an example. The fourth language of Switzerland, Romansh, is under pressure, despite attempts of language preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;After seeing a lot of different things thrown out there, I've decided to take a shot at this one.  I think what you are suggesting is totally possible and plausible.  The confusion of answers arises from that fact that a "word" can be defined in a couple different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reputable definition which allows for your proposed linguistic system is found in the &lt;a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/word_1" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Collins Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A word is a single unit of language that can be represented in writing or speech. In English, a word has a space on either side of it when it is written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By that definition, you have designed three possible "units" which can be assigned the title "words" legitimately, and your language system works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you have other possible definitions, such as that found in &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/word" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Meriam Webster&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A speech sound or series of speech sounds that symbolizes and communicates a meaning usually without being divisible into smaller units capable of independent use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you opt for that definition (which some people do by default), it's a bit harder to stretch "word" to define what you're talking about.  One of your proposed "words" communicates no inherent meaning, and &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; necessarily divisible into smaller units.  Of course, it's a bit ambiguous, and one could argue that this definition of "word" obfuscates the nature of compound nouns etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I would answer, &lt;strong&gt;"It depends."&lt;/strong&gt;  If you define a word simply as a unit of speech separated by spaces, you're all set.  Other linguists might argue however that you ought to define the different "words" as different &lt;em&gt;classes&lt;/em&gt; of words, with the organization of the letters defining words.  And since you're inventing the language, I guess you can set the rules. ☺&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a conlang making heavy use of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Interdentalized sounds, like what  @J. Siebeneichler pointed out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Fully Interdental sounds, where you literally have to bite your tongue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-A Rounded Schwa&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-and a plosive that isn't quite a pharyngeal plosive but sounds like it as it requires the speaker to press the back of their tongue directly against the back of their throat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given, this language isn't really meant for humans, so many of it's other oddities are downright unusable to humans. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Your lang, your rules. But generally speaking, no, you don't need a dative case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny thing is, you don't even need a dative case even if you were to wrack your brain and come up with handfuls of potential situations! Languages are funny that way. Those sneaky native speakers will just come up with some clever way of handling things!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Yours is a very interesting and legitimate question, but in the light of what we know from the languages of the world, what you ask is might not be what you mean to ask. Let me expand a bit below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To answer your question in brief&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;, your language does not need a Dative, but &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;, your language needs a device (or "construction" in Construction Grammar terms) to express the third argument (also called the "indirect object") of verbs that take on three arguments (subject, object, indirect object).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, whether you have separate devices (constructions, or in your case "cases", no pun intended) for semantically different indirect objects or not, that is up to you. Since you already have a Benefactive case that could express an indirect object (whether that is semantically a recipient or a beneficiary or else), then you can use that to express an indirect object that is a simple recipient. So, note that &lt;strong&gt;there can be a mismatch between syntactic arguments and semantic arguments&lt;/strong&gt; (for example indirect object vs. recipient, benefactor, etc). Moreover, depending on what linguistic framework you assume, things can be slightly different. Here I am adhering to some form of (Radical) Construction Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, since you have a Benefactive case and a Lative case you could use the former in sentences like "I gave the book &lt;em&gt;to the man&lt;/em&gt;" and "I opened the door &lt;em&gt;for the woman&lt;/em&gt;" and the Lative case for "I went &lt;em&gt;to the market&lt;/em&gt;" and "I am throwing a stone &lt;em&gt;at you&lt;/em&gt;". But again, that is really up to you, as also hinted at in other answers/comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drafts of the first two chapters of Croft's &lt;em&gt;Morphosyntax: constructions of the world's languages&lt;/em&gt; expand on this. See &lt;a href="https://www.unm.edu/~wcroft/WACpubs.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.unm.edu/~wcroft/WACpubs.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I finally got an answer from the author. The sentence meant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;pona sona pi (wawa pi ma Lipija) poka toki lawa mute pi jan lawa nanpa tu pi ma Atilanisi.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The influence of Libyan power on the election of Atlantis' vice president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest translation was "The strength of Libya beside many commands of vice president of Atlantis" by &lt;code&gt;jastako&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a word-for-word translation for what I understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pona sona&lt;/strong&gt; was in fact &lt;strong&gt;pana sona&lt;/strong&gt;: influence (idea sending)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wawa pi ma Lipija&lt;/strong&gt;: Libyan power&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ma Atilanisi&lt;/strong&gt;: Atlantis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Suggestions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to explain how you would have translated that phrase into toki pona.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Esperanto &lt;em&gt;roots&lt;/em&gt; principally can basically form nouns/adjectives/adverbs and adverbs (and are not words themselves):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-o noun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-a adjective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-e adverb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-i verb, infinitive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roots and derived words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;naci- "nation" - 'noun' root&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nacio = nation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nacia = national&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nacie = nationally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;naciigi = nationalize, suffix -ig' = make ~&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;pens- "thought" - 'verbal' root&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;penso = thought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pensema = thoughtful, suffix -em' = inclined to ~&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pensi = think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pensado = thinking (the ~, noun), suffix -ad' = act of (repeated) ~ing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;hom- "human men/women" - 'noun' root&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;homo = human being&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;homa vivo = human life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;homaro = humanity, -ar' = collection, the collection of humans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;human- = humane - 'adjective'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;humanisto = humanist, -ist'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;humaneco = humanism, the quality of being humane, -ec' = ~ity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;humanismo = humanism, the philosophical movement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So actually the endings do not always guarantee a meaningful word, and the same
for suffixes. Suffixes come into play. The hard thing is to know whether the root
refers to a noun/adjective/verb. And for a verb whether it is transitive or intransitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weird&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in Esperanto is that the root itself is not used; say as noun/adjective/verb. It consistently requires an ending, despite the root often having an identifiable category. National languages have the same usage problems (roots not being flexed to every category),
but do not have this redundancy of endings. For that they have ad-hoc pseudo-suffixes like -al and -ive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might argue that Chinese and English often do not make a distinction between parts of speech. The English &lt;em&gt;success&lt;/em&gt; can either be noun or verb.
However Esperanto was made similar to the European languages but clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note for a conlang one cannot simply drop then noun ending and assume every root to be a noun. You would then have to determine whether always a noun is present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exceptions to non-standalone roots are prepositions, numbers and such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;kun = with, in company of; a word, "preposition"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kuna = common, communal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kune = together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kuniĝi = come together, -iĝ' = become&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;tri = three, a word&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trio = trio, group of three&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tria = third&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trie = thirdly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trioblo = threefold, -obl' = multiple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;triono = a third 1/3, -on' = fraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;triope = by three, in threes, -op' = group of ~&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this answer is a bit Esperanto heavy, but a conlang might benefit from this nice system. How about just -a for nouns: &lt;em&gt;scola, biblioteca, bulgaria&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body_markdown>&lt;p&gt;Esperanto &lt;em&gt;roots&lt;/em&gt; principally can basically form nouns/adjectives/adverbs and adverbs (and are not words themselves):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-o noun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-a adjective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-e adverb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-i verb, infinitive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roots and derived words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;naci- "nation" - 'noun' root&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nacio = nation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nacia = national&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nacie = nationally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;naciigi = nationalize, suffix -ig' = make ~&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;pens- "thought" - 'verbal' root&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;penso = thought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pensema = thoughtful, suffix -em' = inclined to ~&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pensi = think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pensado = thinking (the ~, noun), suffix -ad' = act of (repeated) ~ing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;hom- "human men/women" - 'noun' root&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;homo = human being&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;homa vivo = human life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;homaro = humanity, -ar' = collection, the collection of humans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;human- = humane - 'adjective'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;humanisto = humanist, -ist'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;humaneco = humanism, the quality of being humane, -ec' = ~ity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;humanismo = humanism, the philosophical movement&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a conlang that requires a LOT of work, particularly in the sound changes from proto-lang to the current version. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of creating a whole set of words from nothing, I am considering using lexicon from an existing language and just putting it through sound changes to break it up and save time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factors to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Meaning simplicity- few to no double-meanings or idioms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Rare- Relatively few speakers, perhaps under 5 million to greatly decrease the chances of someone picking up on it (that may be too high or low, I'm not sure myself)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Phonology- Complex enough to do some interesting sound changes but simple enough to easily transcribe (15 to 25 maybe?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Phonotactics- CVC ? This should be easy to copy but also to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Availability- Online dictionaries readily available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I do not want to use a random word generator, as I am terrible at asigning meanings to words just from looking at them. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Well, you could use any language that has a lexicon...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone working out your source language by following the sound change bread crumb trail is problematic or undesirable, what is preventing you from simply using a word generator? Good ones allow you to define phonology and syllable shapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href="http://akana.conlang.org/tools/awkwords/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Awkwords&lt;/a&gt; for a recent project (creating a long text of gibberish) and found it quite suitable. I think it would work for your needs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I would probably go for a fairly homogeneous language, ie one that hasn't had too much contact with other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;English, for example, contains words originating from many other languages (German, Norse, Latin, French,...), so your resulting language will probably also appear mixed wrt to word roots. Other languages (eg maybe Icelandic) will have had less external influences (especially if they are politically controlled), and so the vocabulary will generally be more homogeneous, and might be a better source for you. Unless, of course, your conlang is meant for a trading/colonial society.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;One suggestion I'd give: use Proto-Indo-European lexicon for the words you want in your own proto-language, then use a word generator to create the actual roots of your language. That way you're not going to run into the problem of a having a word list that accidentally includes terms your proto-speakers would be unlikely to have.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A lot of good suggestions are already in here, here are some more&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use another conlang as a base for your vocabulary, for an unusual feel I suggest Volapük or Lojban&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independent of the base you choose, apply some unnatural transformation to the roots to make them look unfamiliar. Potential unnatural transformations include reverting the roots (spelling them backwards), syllable swapping like in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Verlan&lt;/a&gt;, or a cyclic permutation of the letters (putting the first letter at the end or the last letter at the start)&lt;/li&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Some of Trent Pehrson's ornamental scripts (for conlangs) fit this description somewhat, in that they lack a sense of formal arrangement and can be organised in very creative ways which sometimes appear to focus on a central hub. Trent is a gifted calligrapher and I urge you to check out examples of his outstanding work: &lt;a href="http://idrani.perastar.com/ISMS_orthography.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://idrani.perastar.com/ISMS_orthography.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe start here: &lt;a href="http://idrani.perastar.com/orthography/ksatlai/eikiyo.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://idrani.perastar.com/orthography/ksatlai/eikiyo.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have designed concentric systems, where an utterance is written beginning with a central shape, enclosed in another shape, enclosed in another shape, and so on. Both Mayan glyphs and Jonathan Gabel's Mayan-inspired Sitelen Sitelen script for writing Toki Pona use enclosure to some degree, though not to the same extent as my example, which produced interesting but unwieldy heavily concentric text objects. (I started to think about making 3D realisations where the text would be read by cutting through the object and reading it in various ways sort of like tree lines.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I started work on a hub-and-spoke type script with no attached spoken language, where sentences are conceived of as wheels with different areas of the wheel being reserved for different syntactic roles, using a small glyph set of symbols whose meaning alters depending on its position in the wheel. These spokes can have spokes of their own. These sentence wheels can be combined around a central hub to create multi-sentence texts: the central hub contains emotional information about the writer's attitude towards the meaning of the text, and organisational information to help the reader decode the whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also designed a phonetic abugida (originally for Pandunia, not that it needs or wants it!) arranged something like hangeul, with the oddity that words with more than three syllables are written with double glyphs which combine left- and right-facing halves: the left-most syllable cluster marks its vowels to the left, and the right-most syllable cluster marks its vowels to the right. The overall arrangement of each glyph is also bottom to top (I was sick of scripts assuming that you must always start at the top for everything...) See this bizarrely coloured example made in Pics Art of the Pandunia word 'musikosake', music bag, written first without vowels, and secondly with. The left-most half encodes 'musiko', the right-most 'sake'; m is at the bottom left, above it s, above it k; s appears again on the right, then k above it. Aesthetically the vowels are meant to look like bubbles floating upwards, and the letter shapes are designed so as not to impede the flow of the eye even though information is encoded on both sides of the main glyph. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uj85U.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uj85U.png" alt="pandunia du musikosake"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gave rise to the idea that words in a sentence should be arranged similarly, in balanced pairs or pyramidal shapes starting from the centre of the base. One could write on a square page by turning it lozenge-way, beginning above the middle corner-to corner line, writing from the middle first one way then the other, then going above, creating a pyramid fitting into the paper shape; then repeating under the line by turning the page upside down. Or by writing in upwards columns up to four glyphs wide, where the central or centre-left glyph is the first, aiming to keep syntactic groups such as phrases within one row of, at a maximum, 24 syllables. This would produce columns of glyphs read as 1, 12, 213, and 2134 depending on their weight. Whichever macroarrangement one might choose, overall its arrangement as a script is centrally focused in various ways, inspired by the central focus of each glyph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say this has some precedent in various South Asian scripts such as Thai in which, whilst there is a firm left-right directionality in the flow of the syllabic characters, within each character there is a much more chaotic flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rikchik's fascinating writing system is also arguably graphically 'middle-leading': &lt;a href="https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/rikchik.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/rikchik.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to whether any natural scripts do what you're asking about to any significant extent, other than the example about re Egyptian hieroglyphs and the minor concentric features of Mayan about which I am no expert, I am not aware of any examples - which doesn't at all mean they don't exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe start here: &lt;a href="http://idrani.perastar.com/orthography/ksatlai/eikiyo.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://idrani.perastar.com/orthography/ksatlai/eikiyo.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have designed concentric systems, where an utterance is written beginning with a central shape, enclosed in another shape, enclosed in another shape, and so on. Both Mayan glyphs and Jonathan Gabel's Mayan-inspired Sitelen Sitelen script for writing Toki Pona use enclosure to some degree, though not to the same extent as my example, which produced interesting but unwieldy heavily concentric text objects. (I started to think about making 3D realisations where the text would be read by cutting through the object and reading it in various ways sort of like tree lines.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I started work on a hub-and-spoke type script with no attached spoken language, where sentences are conceived of as wheels with different areas of the wheel being reserved for different syntactic roles, using a small glyph set of symbols whose meaning alters depending on its position in the wheel. These spokes can have spokes of their own. These sentence wheels can be combined around a central hub to create multi-sentence texts: the central hub contains emotional information about the writer's attitude towards the meaning of the text, and organisational information to help the reader decode the whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also designed a phonetic abugida (originally for Pandunia, not that it needs or wants it!) arranged something like hangeul, with the oddity that words with more than three syllables are written with double glyphs which combine left- and right-facing halves: the left-most syllable cluster marks its vowels to the left, and the right-most syllable cluster marks its vowels to the right. The overall arrangement of each glyph is also bottom to top (I was sick of scripts assuming that you must always start at the top for everything...) See this bizarrely coloured example made in Pics Art of the Pandunia word 'musikosake', music bag, written first without vowels, and secondly with. The left-most half encodes 'musiko', the right-most 'sake'; m is at the bottom left, above it s, above it k; s appears again on the right, then k above it. Aesthetically the vowels are meant to look like bubbles floating upwards, and the letter shapes are designed so as not to impede the flow of the eye even though information is encoded on both sides of the main glyph. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uj85U.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uj85U.png" alt="pandunia du musikosake"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gave rise to the idea that words in a sentence should be arranged similarly, in balanced pairs or pyramidal shapes starting from the centre of the base. One could write on a square page by turning it lozenge-way, beginning above the middle corner-to corner line, writing from the middle first one way then the other, then going above, creating a pyramid fitting into the paper shape; then repeating under the line by turning the page upside down. Or by writing in upwards columns up to four glyphs wide, where the central or centre-left glyph is the first, aiming to keep syntactic groups such as phrases within one row of, at a maximum, 24 syllables. This would produce columns of glyphs read as 1, 12, 213, and 2134 depending on their weight. Whichever macroarrangement one might choose, overall its arrangement as a script is centrally focused in various ways, inspired by the central focus of each glyph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say this has some precedent in various South Asian scripts such as Thai in which, whilst there is a firm left-right directionality in the flow of the syllabic characters, within each character there is a much more chaotic flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rikchik's fascinating writing system is also arguably graphically 'middle-leading': &lt;a href="https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/rikchik.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/rikchik.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to whether any natural scripts do what you're asking about to any significant extent, other than the example about re Egyptian hieroglyphs and the minor concentric features of Mayan about which I am no expert, I am not aware of any examples - which doesn't at all mean they don't exist.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;If we consider that the purpose of a constructed language is simply and purely created for Human interractions (like esperanto), mathematics cannot be considered as a conlang because it lacks one important thing that human language has: &lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;He said it last time
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to both have the same context to understand the meaning. &lt;strong&gt;Mathematics and Computer programming languages doesn't reach at all this level of tacit agreement&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, now I also believe that mathematics help Human to understand and express things in a more abstract way. To make a rough comparison, &lt;strong&gt;we could then consider a constructed language as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;General Purpose programming Language&lt;/a&gt; + Context and mathematics as Domain &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Specific programming Language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;What would be the best choice of niqqud to transliterate &lt;a href="http://www.tokipona.net" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;toki pona&lt;/a&gt; vowel sounds using Hebrew? I'm trying to use the niqqud that would be closest to what is normally used in Hebrew. Should 'e' be אֶ or אֵ? Should o be וֹ or אֹ? Should 'a' be אַ or אָ? Is there a real difference between them or is it important? I would normally omit the niqqud, since toki pona is minimalist &amp; somewhat ambiguous anyway, but I would prefer to use the most phonetically accurate niqqud, when I do use them. There is stress on the first syllable, but no long vowels. would it be unusual to write 'pana' as ַפָנה to show that the first 'a' is stressed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I would write 'seli' as סלי, but with vowels would סֶלִי or סֵלִי be better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;toki would be טוקי, but should I want to use vowels, should I use טוֹקִי or טֹקִי&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did find &lt;a href="https://www.stevemorse.org/hebrew/eng2heb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; tool for transliterating to hebrew, but it ignores niqqud altogether. 'O' is always written as 'ו', &amp; 'E' isn't written at all, even at the end of a word. At the beginning of a word it's just 'א'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vowel sounds are:
a: father
e: get
o: more
i: peel (I would use either ִא or אִי. Is there a difference?)
u: food (I would use וּ. Would it be better to use אֻ instead?)&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm as pro-Occidental as they come (it's the only auxiliary language that I support) but I came across that article in 1928 during my typing up the archives of Cosmoglotta and that article is nothing more than Ric Berger wishful thinking. He unfortunately spent just as much time attacking Ido as he did supporting Occidental, and kept on proclaiming it to be moribund and ready to collapse for some 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the article in question that he wrote in 1928 on the Ido conference from which he concluded that Ido was on its last legs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cosmoglotta.pbworks.com/w/page/132587775/Cosmoglotta%20A%20053%20%28oct%201928%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://cosmoglotta.pbworks.com/w/page/132587775/Cosmoglotta%20A%20053%20%28oct%201928%29&lt;/a&gt; (Title: Raport del Occidental-Observator Ric. Berger al Association «Cosmoglotta», Wien.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the answer is no. However, it's also true that the majority of the Occidentalists at that time were once Idists, from Berger to Gär to Ramstedt to Pigal to de Guesnet and all the rest. There was definitely a large influx from Ido to Occidental, and Occidental as far as I can tell was the most active auxiliary language after Esperanto by the late 30s and into the 1940s. Matejka and Berger had a lot of back-and-forth in the 1920s to early 1930s until Matejka decided to move over to Occidental, which he stayed with until his death in the late 1990s. He's probably the most prominent example of a major Idist who went full in on Occidental. But Berger hadn't taken into account the other source for new Idists, namely new users who weren't satisfied with Esperanto but still liked the overall concept (i.e. the people that thought that Zamenhof &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; got it right).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I removed that sentence from Wikipedia last year when going through the Cosmoglotta archives because it certainly isn't backed up by anything besides Berger's wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ways to deal with the problem of marking the vowels unambiguously:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Style 1 - normal Hebrew orthography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the fact that there are no length distinctions or gemination, a transliteration into Hebrew would normally use exclusively these diacritics to represent the vowels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a אָ *
e אֵ ** 
i אִי  
o אוֹ  
u אוּ
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; &lt;sub&gt;add ה at the end of a word; and after letters other than א, add א in the middle of a word&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; &lt;sub&gt;add ה at the end of a word&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, on נ (the only possibly coda in Toki Pona) the diacritic נְ would be used (except as last letter of word). Stress isn't normally marked even in vowelized Hebrew (apart from liturgy or texts for learners), and it's entirely unnecessary in Toki Pona, since there is no phonemic stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of this is that it follows ordinary conventions and is most easily intelligible to someone reading in Hebrew. The disadvantage is that implementing this kind of orthography is far from algorithmic and includes unnecessary information in the spelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Style 2 - minimalistic Hebrew orthography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Toki Pona is a minimalistic language, I think that a different transliteration convention would better suit it, to avoid redundancy in writing it. There is precedent for a more minimalistic transcription in the convention used for transliterating, e.g., Akkadian into Hebrew. Modifying it to suit Toki Pona's vowels, we get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a אָ  
e אֵ  
i אִ  
o אֹ  
u אֻ
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Style 3 - Yiddish orthography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third option, if you want to minimize use of diacritics, is to follow Yiddish spelling conventions. The only required diacritic is to distinguish between the two forms of א. The Yiddish convention of using וו instead of ו as a consonant can be safely ignored in Toki Pona. And actually, since there are &lt;a href="http://www.tokipona.net/tp/MinimalPairs.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;no o/u minimal pairs in Toki Pona&lt;/a&gt;, you could get rid of all diacritics if you instead choose to use ו for both vowels, at the price of losing some information (style 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a אַ or א
e ע or ע
i אי
o אָ or ו
u ו
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sample differences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Roman x Hebrew x Minimal x Yiddish x 4-vowel
a     x אָ      x אָ       x אַ       x א
akesi x אָקֵסִי   x אָקֵסִ    x אַקעסי   x אקעסי
anpa  x אָנְפָה   x אָנפָ    x אַנפאַ    x אנפא
mije  x מִייֵה   x ֵמִי     x מייע    x מייע
mute  x מוּטֵה   x ֵמֻט     x מוטע    x מוטע
seli  x סֵלִי    x ִסֵל     x סעלי    x סעלי
toki  x טוֹקִי   x טֹקִ     x טאָקי    x טוקי
wawa  x וָאוָה   x וָוָ     x ואַואַ    x ואוא
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; &lt;sub&gt;add ה at the end of a word; and after letters other than א, add א in the middle of a word&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; &lt;sub&gt;add ה at the end of a word&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, on נ (the only possibly coda in Toki Pona) the diacritic נְ would be used (except as last letter of word). Stress isn't normally marked even in vowelized Hebrew (apart from liturgy or texts for learners), and it's entirely unnecessary in Toki Pona, since there is no phonemic stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of this is that it follows ordinary conventions and is most easily intelligible to someone reading in Hebrew. The disadvantage is that implementing this kind of orthography is far from algorithmic and includes unnecessary information in the spelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Style 2 - minimalistic Hebrew orthography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Toki Pona is a minimalistic language, I think that a different transliteration convention would better suit it, to avoid redundancy in writing it. There is precedent for a more minimalistic transcription in the convention used for transliterating, e.g., Akkadian into Hebrew. Modifying it to suit Toki Pona's vowels, we get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a אָ  
e אֵ  
i אִ  
o אֹ  
u אֻ
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Style 3 - Yiddish orthography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third option, if you want to minimize use of diacritics, is to follow Yiddish spelling conventions. The only required diacritic is to distinguish between the two forms of א. The Yiddish convention of using וו instead of ו as a consonant can be safely ignored in Toki Pona. And actually, since there are &lt;a href="http://www.tokipona.net/tp/MinimalPairs.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;no o/u minimal pairs in Toki Pona&lt;/a&gt;, you could get rid of all diacritics if you instead choose to use ו for both vowels, at the price of losing some information (style 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a אַ or א
e ע or ע
i אי
o אָ or ו
u ו
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sample differences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Roman x Hebrew x Minimal x Yiddish x 4-vowel
a     x אָ      x אָ       x אַ       x א
akesi x אָקֵסִי   x אָקֵסִ    x אַקעסי   x אקעסי

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I am developing conlang that has grammatical cases system for nominals that for each spatial case there is state-based case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Finnic languages grammatical cases that denote states occur, examples in Finnish:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essive&lt;/strong&gt; (ESS) with the ending &lt;em&gt;-na&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;-nä&lt;/em&gt; denotes being in state, corresponds to the combination 'as X' in English. &lt;em&gt;lapsi&lt;/em&gt; - 'child', &lt;em&gt;lapsena&lt;/em&gt; - 'as child / being a child'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dialectal &lt;strong&gt;Exessive&lt;/strong&gt; (EXESS) with the ending &lt;em&gt;-nta&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;-ntä&lt;/em&gt; denotes a departure from state, corresponding to English 'from being X...'. &lt;em&gt;lapsi&lt;/em&gt; - 'child', &lt;em&gt;lapsenta&lt;/em&gt; - 'from being child'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translative&lt;/strong&gt; (TRANSL) with the ending &lt;em&gt;-ksi&lt;/em&gt; denotes a transition into state, corresponds to English 'to (becoming) X'. &lt;em&gt;aikuinen&lt;/em&gt; - 'adult', &lt;em&gt;aikuiseksi&lt;/em&gt; - 'to adult'. &lt;em&gt;lapsenta aikuiseksi&lt;/em&gt; = '[maturing] from child to adult'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is clear spatial analogy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locative ↔ Essive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ablative ↔ Exessive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allative ↔ Translative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can construct state-based analogues to other spatial cases. For example, for the Prolative case ('through X') we can make Essive-Prolative, which would mean 'passing through a state of being X / through way of being X"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a Hungarian grammatical case called &lt;strong&gt;Distributive&lt;/strong&gt; (DISTR) with the ending &lt;em&gt;-nként&lt;/em&gt;, which is equivalent to 'per X'. For example, &lt;em&gt;hét&lt;/em&gt; - 'week', &lt;em&gt;hetenként&lt;/em&gt; - 'weekly, once per week'. It has a clear spatial-temporal nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to come up with a state based analogue for this case. Let's call it '&lt;em&gt;Essive-distributive&lt;/em&gt;', but I am stuck with the expansion of the analogy. What exactly can 'per being in state' mean? Can anyone suggest a meaning and usage for such a case?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I suspect you could just make up a name. That's certainly a legitimate glossopoetical strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In English, i'd just call it a distributive sense of the state-noun and have done with it: &lt;em&gt;Such-and-such only happens thrice per childhood, you know!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or ...&lt;em&gt;thrice childhoodly&lt;/em&gt; if you prefer!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I frankly don't get the difference between LOC/ABL/ALL &amp; ESS/EXESS/TRANSL, which I'm guessing must be a Finnish Thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would understand "in the child" and "in childhood" to be locative senses of the thing-noun and state-noun respectively; "from the child" &amp; "from childhood" likewise are ablative. So it is for "per child" and "per childhood", being the distributive sense.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;If I understand you correctly (big &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; there!), you are looking for a periodical state that repeats, not necessarily at the same time interval (though the two might in reality be linked) &amp;mdash; as it happens we are using the sun rising as a proxy for the time passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be a tree blossoming, or losing its leaves. It could be the tide coming in. It could be birds migrating and passing through. It could be a woman's menstrual cycle. It could be being asleep/awake. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Interesting concept for a case. In my interpretation this kind of an abstract distributive case would apply in sentences like this one (a probably very clumsy reformulation of a famous first sentence in literature)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every unhappy family is different &lt;strong&gt;in their unhappiness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked up the really case-rich conlang &lt;a href="http://www.ithkuil.net/04_case.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Ithkuil&lt;/a&gt; and did not find a precedent for this kind of case. Feel free to name it by any name you like. When you don't have an own idea, I suggest &lt;em&gt;respective case&lt;/em&gt; for that one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Actually they are, they are called formal languages, following classic logic theory (with intuitive sets)
We can stablish something called FOL (first order logic) which is an actual language, however the expresability of such a language is not as great as a conventional semantic language.
Thats why we don't use math or programming languages as a way of communicating complex or "human" ideas. That's also why we keep using words of conventional languages while proving theorems in math. However there have been attempts to express such mathematical ideas just by using symbols but the results are extremely complicated and confusing.
But indeed, as a philosophical and logical point of view math is a no so expressive language. &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Try Khmer, (Cambodian) it has about 17 million speakers, a fun alphabet (abugida) where the two different series of consonants changes the vowel marker's sound. There's no inflection, it's very analytical, and it has a ridiculous number of glottal stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part the phonotactics are CVC, but you don't say most of the consonants at the end of a word and instead do a glottal stop. It's an asian language, but it's not tonal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus it also has a completely different vocabulary depending on whether you are talking about the king or not.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Creating a conlang is usually only half (or less than half!) of the necessary effort: someone has to be able to learn it, unless you want to keep it as your own private secret code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Duolingo to learn various languages, and it does of course have an Esperanto course on it, as well as Klingon and High Valyrian. However, it is unlikely that it will feature many more Conlangs, especially not one that you will develop yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is of course not feasible to re-implement all of Duolingo's features, but I was just wondering if there are any apps/websites that you can use to develop an on-line course for your own conlang (it has to be fully automated, with no human teaching involved).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there something along the lines of Duolingo available where you can create your own courses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's been talk that I found on Duolingo forums, but if they're at all serious, they probably won't allow "dabbling". You'd need a serious effort to make and maintain enough lessons for people to actually learn a language.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Looking at the list of fallacies you quote, I would say this is not possible &amp;mdash; most of them have got nothing to do with the language itself, but with the way it is used. It's a bit like making a kitchen knife that you cannot use to hurt someone with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Fallacy of Composition&lt;/a&gt; is related to reasoning. I cannot think of any way that a language can make that impossible. As long as you have expressive power in the language to express anything, you can express incorrect reasoning as well. The same goes for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_attribution" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;False Attribution&lt;/a&gt;, which is about how you use language, not anything in the language itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki%27s_Wager" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Loki's Wager&lt;/a&gt; refers to the absence of clear definitions or boundaries. The world is not clear-cut, so language cannot be like that either. Defining where the head starts and the neck ends is unrelated to language. Unless you want to accompany each word in that language with a &lt;em&gt;book&lt;/em&gt; that defines exactly what it means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_accent" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Fallacy of Accent&lt;/a&gt; is a problem, unless you take stress patterns out of the language, which then is a lot less usable, as stress is a good way of expressing nuances of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_ambiguity" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Syntactic ambiguity&lt;/a&gt; is about the only one which could be avoided through careful language design. But most 'usable' languages have some of that as well, especially if they are reasonably complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these verbal fallacies are to do with the way you use language and express meanings, which you could do in any language. Syntactic ambiguities crop up more often than you would think, but unless you are a linguist, you won't even notice most of them, as it is usually very clear which meaning is the appropriate one in the context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my answer is no, because it is not even possible to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Let's start with some numbers: Esperanto started with 900 radicals (which is different from the number of words that can be formed from that radicals) while &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua#Development_of_a_new_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Interlingua&lt;/a&gt; debuted with a dictionary containing the impressive number of 27000 words. The last number is surely very much on the upper end for a conlang creation, one tenth of it is more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a realistic starting number for a not too schematic language (e.g., avoiding something like the Esperanto prefix &lt;em&gt;mal-&lt;/em&gt; as an obligatory tool to construct an antonym) would lie in the region of 2000 words including some derivational morphology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have statistics on how many words conlangers create on average, but there are certainly some conlang enthusiasts out there who just love to create words and to give them etymologies (based on the real world or fictional ones). Those enthusiasts may create very rich constructed vocabularies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The answer to both of these questions lies somewhere between "it depends" and "let's speculate a little".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The act of inventing a &lt;em&gt;naturalistic&lt;/em&gt; language does not necessarily mean that you must also create a &lt;em&gt;naturalistically&lt;/em&gt; large lexicon. After all, it's the grammar, the syntax, the usability in a wide variety of normal contexts that determines naturalism.  A natural language might have anywhere &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dictionaries_by_number_of_words" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;between 15000 and 1,000,000 words&lt;/a&gt;. And as you can see from the several English entries, there's not even a consensus as to how many words there are in a language. The number of words you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; create is entirely up to you. A more interesting question, interesting in the broad sense of course!, is &lt;em&gt;how many words is enough words to create?&lt;/em&gt; This is not only more interesting to consider, but also harder to answer because there is no pat response and any answer given will be purely opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd argue that 2000 is a bare bones lower estimation, given that this is the lexicon size for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Basic English&lt;/a&gt;. But B.E. isn't exactly "naturalistic", so that figure is undoubtedly low. Somewhere between 3000 and 6000 gives you a little more than dry bones to gnaw on!, but still hardly approaches the naturalism of a natural language, to say nothing of the works of the more gung ho kind of lexicophilic glossopoets!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the second question, we do have some recent figures. The results of &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EMDqQ4xO600Pn3hMTRFs6xcUOBbIBEF8s7vNkaRTlN4/edit" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a recent survey&lt;/a&gt; of language inventors determined a spread of approximately 500 (+/-) to &gt;5,000 over 246 respondents. Of note are the lowest and highest categories, with about 70% of respondents falling into the &lt;500 &amp; &gt;5000 categories. The remaining 30% fall between 500 and 5000 words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://conlang.stackexchange.com/a/1034/52"&gt;Jesse Adam's answer&lt;/a&gt; already does a good job of establishing that programming languages do not have the same expressive power as human language. The notation used in mathematics certainly also does not have the same descriptive power, but it may be useful to look at representations of human language using formal logic, as that's probably the closest tie between linguistics and mathematics that you've got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formal semantics, as a discipline, does a lot of work defining a languages grammar using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;typed lambda calculus&lt;/a&gt; (something many computer scientists and mathematicians may have encountered before). This generally follows in the tradition of logician Richard Montague, creating what is called a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montague_grammar" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Montague grammar&lt;/a&gt;. In a grammar such as this, a sentence like "Every woman sees a man" is represented as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;∀x(woman′(x) → (∃y(man′(y) ∧ sees′(x,y)))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in order to derive this compositionally (i.e., from the meaning of each word in the sentence combined together), the meanings of each word is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"woman" = λx.woman′(x)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"man" = λx.man′(x)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"sees" = λy.λx.sees′(x,y)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"a" = λP.λQ.∃x((P(x)∧Q(x)))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"every" = λP.λQ.∀x((P(x)∧Q(x)))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you can already see a problem here -- where do we actually get the meanings of woman′ and man′ and sees′ from? In this type of grammar, any noun like "woman" or "man" is a function mapping entities to boolean values -- in other words, "woman" is a list of every entity that exists in the world and either a 1 or a 0 depending whether that entity is a woman. A transitive verb like "sees" is a function that maps entities to entities to boolean values based on whether the first entity sees the second entity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, as you can imagine, isn't a super satisfying way to define a word -- defining "woman" as the set of all women is kinda circular, at best -- but semanticists generally acknowledge that the meaning of individual lexical items just cannot be formalized like this and leave that for lexical semanticists to figure out (and they, to my knowledge, generally do not try to formalize the meanings of individual words like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this has all been sort of a tangent from your original question, but in short: mathematics and the notation we use for it are not language in and of themselves, but there are formal/mathematical ways of representing human language. These formalisms can capture a lot about the relationships between words in a language, but they struggle to capture the actual meaning of a particular word, and thus in that way still ultimately fall short of the underlying expressive power of human language unless augmented with some way of truly capturing a content word's meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most conlangs aim to emulate the expressive capabilities of human language and, as such, we generally would not consider formal languages like programming languages or lambda calculus conlangs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, as you can imagine, isn't a super satisfying way to define a word -- defining "woman" as the set of all women is kinda circular, at best -- but semanticists generally acknowledge that the meaning of individual lexical items just cannot be formalized like this and leave that for lexical semanticists to figure out (and they, to my knowledge, generally do not try to formalize the meanings of individual words like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this has all been sort of a tangent from your original question, but in short: mathematics and the notation we use for it are not language in and of themselves, but there are formal/mathematical ways of representing human language. These formalisms can capture a lot about the relationships between words in a language, but they struggle to capture the actual meaning of a particular word, and thus in that way still ultimately fall short of the underlying expressive power of human language unless augmented with some way of truly capturing a content word's meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most conlangs aim to emulate the expressive capabilities of human language and, as such, we generally would not consider formal languages like programming languages or lambda calculus conlangs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Information on a minimum useful vocabulary size appears within &lt;a href="https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/41385/is-there-a-more-effective-way-to-build-a-language-than-a-word-frequency-list/41390#41390"&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt; to a question on Worldbuilding SE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don't have a reference but some philologists and linguists have speculated that you could survive (explain who you are, ask for employment and food, etc.) in a foreign land with as few as 500 words. Henry C. Fenn, author of several language texts, felt that a vocabulary of 5000 words was sufficient to support learning new words by context, e.g. by conversing with natives and reading newspapers. In my own experience as a linguist and translator I found 5000 generic words plus about 2000 topical words (those popular for only a few years) sufficient for keeping up with current events. This gives you some idea of the vocabulary size you should be considering.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to transliterate toki pona words containing an 'eh' sound like 'esun', 'en', 'kule', 'ken' &amp; 'seme'. 
I found an online Kurdish transliteration tool that displays 'esun' ‌as ئه‌سون  &amp; 'kule' as کوله‌. Is that accurate? I've also seen ێ used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the tool gives the initial vowels as: ئا for a, ئه‌/ئە for e, ی/ئی for i, ئۆ/ۆ for o, &amp; ئو for u.  is there a difference sound-wise between ه‌ and ة (as in سه‌مه/سةمة-'seme')?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of using only harakat for vowels when possible &amp; leaving them out if not neccesary for comprehension like کَلاَ/کلا instead of کالا for 'kala',(except for finals to make 'sin'/'sina' &amp; 'pan'/'pana' clear) because it fits the minimalist nature of toki pona, but e (as in b&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;t) &amp; o (as in &lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt;pen) are a problem since they don't really exist in Arabic. I would probably use 'ۆ/ئۆ' for o, but is ه‌/ة or ێ better for 'e'? Could I use ِسِمه for 'seme' or is سةمة/سه‌مه‌ better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is 'میِ کن سِتِلِن إِ تۆکیِ یۆکیِ پۆناَ کِپِکِن سِتِلِن أَلَپیِ' a reasonable transliteration for 'mi ken sitelen e toki toki pona kepeken sitelen Alapi' or should 'kepeken' be کەپەکەن?&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;I don't know if it's "pu" (official) or not, but the whole point of toki pona is that it's very simple/minimalist so the idea is not to say any more than is absolutely necessary to describe something so I would think it would be discouraged. 'coffee' is generally translated as 'telo pimeja wawa'(dark water/liquid of strength/energy).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In some sentences it's a lot like 'は' in Japanese 'タナカさん&lt;strong&gt;は&lt;/strong&gt;先生です' Mr Tanaka &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a teacher. The toki pona equivalent would be 'jan Tanaka &lt;strong&gt;li&lt;/strong&gt; jan pi pana sona'.&lt;/p&gt;
